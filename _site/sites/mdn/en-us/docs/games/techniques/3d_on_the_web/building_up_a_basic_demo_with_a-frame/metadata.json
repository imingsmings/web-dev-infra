Mozilla's A-Frame framework provides a markup language allowing us to build 3D VR landscapes using a system familiar to web developers, which follows game development coding principles; this is useful for quickly and successfully building prototypes and demos, without having to write a lot of JavaScript or GLSL. This article explains how to get up and running with A-Frame, and how to use it to build up a simple demo.","popularity":0.0019,"modified":"2023-12-04T18:27:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/building_up_a_basic_demo_with_a-frame","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/building_up_a_basic_demo_with_a-frame/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/af17418720844a3db9825011a533d10722051bfc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Building up a basic demo with A-Frame","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games","title":"Game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques","title":"Techniques for game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web","title":"3D games on the Web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_A-Frame","title":"Building up a basic demo with A-Frame"}],"pageTitle":"Building up a basic demo with A-Frame - Game development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"743a0699f2aec3da8bb7fdd29845cf99a67872f1f9c423d6ee912d76529d935c"}
