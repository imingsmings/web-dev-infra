GLSL is executed directly by the graphics pipeline. There are several kinds of shaders, but two are commonly used to create graphics on the web: Vertex Shaders and Fragment (Pixel) Shaders. Vertex Shaders transform shape positions into 3D drawing coordinates. Fragment Shaders compute the renderings of a shape's colors and other attributes.","popularity":0.0103,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/glsl_shaders","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/glsl_shaders/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"GLSL Shaders","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games","title":"Game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques","title":"Techniques for game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web","title":"3D games on the Web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders","title":"GLSL Shaders"}],"pageTitle":"GLSL Shaders - Game development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"4ebde1a3e394a01587958e3f6992d249bf2f7577c9f1f513d9e9bbb765ee61c4"}
