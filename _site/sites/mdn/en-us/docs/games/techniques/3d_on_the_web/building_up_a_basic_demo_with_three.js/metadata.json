In this article we'll take you through the real basics of using Three, including setting up a development environment, structuring the necessary HTML, the fundamental objects of Three, and how to build up a basic demo.","popularity":0.0026,"modified":"2023-12-01T15:46:22.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/building_up_a_basic_demo_with_three.js","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/games/techniques/3d_on_the_web/building_up_a_basic_demo_with_three.js/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/18f8a648a108b146e8edadee8dca89cc24b863d6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Building up a basic demo with Three.js","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games","title":"Game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques","title":"Techniques for game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web","title":"3D games on the Web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/Building_up_a_basic_demo_with_Three.js","title":"Building up a basic demo with Three.js"}],"pageTitle":"Building up a basic demo with Three.js - Game development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"7238abc8167f6dec1c91adb3e21612f681055f4b8a2d18717b5f1e8ca3b4c9e2"}
