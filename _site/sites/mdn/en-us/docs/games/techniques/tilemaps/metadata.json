This results in performance and memory usage gains â€” big image files containing entire level maps are not needed, as they are constructed by small images or image fragments multiple times. This set of articles covers the basics of creating tile maps using JavaScript and Canvas (although the same high level techniques could be used in any programming language.)","popularity":0.0073,"modified":"2023-06-28T16:09:36.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/games/techniques/tilemaps","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/games/techniques/tilemaps/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/56db19e6b8d19932c1b6150bc42e752e12a2b21f","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Tiles and tilemaps overview","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games","title":"Game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques","title":"Techniques for game development"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps","title":"Tiles and tilemaps overview"}],"pageTitle":"Tiles and tilemaps overview - Game development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f6d4f63346d9bea610b4dfdce684337f2408d471cb12b67de37b359b84e77124"}
