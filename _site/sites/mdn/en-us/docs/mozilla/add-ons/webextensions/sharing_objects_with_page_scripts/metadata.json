This means that, for example, if a web page loads a library like jQuery, content scripts won't be able to use it, and have to load their own copy. Conversely, scripts loaded by web pages can't see changes made by content scripts.","popularity":0.0025,"modified":"2023-07-11T07:33:08.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mozilla/add-ons/webextensions/sharing_objects_with_page_scripts","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mozilla/add-ons/webextensions/sharing_objects_with_page_scripts/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/1079b152415f26432481498d2d2b4e8b2f81e3e0","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Share objects with page scripts","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla","title":"Mozilla"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons","title":"Add-ons"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions","title":"Browser extensions"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Sharing_objects_with_page_scripts","title":"Share objects with page scripts"}],"pageTitle":"Share objects with page scripts - Mozilla | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"d06541be8ba3c2d7d0fdd5f863f49724dcafd0ec1751ab0da7419c78af7d7010"}
