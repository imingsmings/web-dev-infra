Prior to this, there was no way to directly indicate that a request was of a different priority. The API is defined in nsISupportsPriority, but is defined in very generic terms so that any object can implement this interface to enable the concept of priority. This article deals specifically with using that interface to change the priority of HTTP requests.","popularity":0.0008,"modified":"2023-07-17T23:31:02.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/1.5/changing_the_priority_of_http_requests","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/1.5/changing_the_priority_of_http_requests/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/75d6ce4e2e752b8577012aea96abc766659ed3e2","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Changing the Priority of HTTP Requests (Non-Standard)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla","title":"Mozilla"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox","title":"Firefox"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases","title":"Firefox release notes for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/1.5","title":"Firefox 1.5 for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/1.5/Changing_the_priority_of_HTTP_requests","title":"Changing the Priority of HTTP Requests (Non-Standard)"}],"pageTitle":"Changing the Priority of HTTP Requests (Non-Standard) - Mozilla | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"96d370d8329033a52e2fe7b73fbfc0081500f81e7abeba9de0c66932af96f7e8"}
