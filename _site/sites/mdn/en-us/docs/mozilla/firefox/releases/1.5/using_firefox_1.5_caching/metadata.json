Going backward and forward between visited pages requires no page loading and the JavaScript states are preserved. This feature, referred to by some as bfcache (for \"Back-Forward Cache\"), makes page navigation very fast. This caching state is preserved until the user closes the browser.","popularity":0.0016,"modified":"2023-07-04T00:00:29.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/1.5/using_firefox_1.5_caching","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/1.5/using_firefox_1.5_caching/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/7f74644d98484c67817c1dd556a6e394f5a26a6f","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using Firefox 1.5 caching","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla","title":"Mozilla"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox","title":"Firefox"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases","title":"Firefox release notes for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/1.5","title":"Firefox 1.5 for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/1.5/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching","title":"Using Firefox 1.5 caching"}],"pageTitle":"Using Firefox 1.5 caching - Mozilla | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"32f1bf7492854605e1a1a03062391d9641ab06f5e65417c1fca8c6c2343fe321"}
