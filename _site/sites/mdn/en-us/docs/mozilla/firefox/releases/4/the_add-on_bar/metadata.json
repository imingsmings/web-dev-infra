This new toolbar, with the ID \"addon-bar\", is a standard XUL <toolbar>; add-ons can insert content into it, and the user can drag buttons into it while customizing their toolbars. This is the primary difference between the add-on bar and the old status bar; you can now put any XUL element into it, since it's a standard toolbar.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-12-07T16:15:22.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/4/the_add-on_bar","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mozilla/firefox/releases/4/the_add-on_bar/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/9b721e93b4ab2712ddb46827008eaea3ce43d00c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"The add-on bar","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla","title":"Mozilla"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox","title":"Firefox"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases","title":"Firefox release notes for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/4","title":"Firefox 4 for developers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/4/The_add-on_bar","title":"The add-on bar"}],"pageTitle":"The add-on bar - Mozilla | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8c55027201a7caf2a34c3032a52e1aaab133cd2e3f03a408cfd40d76ef31eb80"}
