Since that's a universal issue, we won't be focusing on it too much here. Instead, we're going to look at a more important issue when building Web apps: starting up as <strong>asynchronously</strong> as possible. That means not running all your startup code in a single event handler on the app's main thread.</p>\n<p>Rather, create a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">Web worker</a> that does as much as possible in a background thread (for example, fetching and processing data.) Relegating tasks to a Web worker frees up the main thread for tasks requiring it, like user events and rendering UI. In turn, main thread events should consist of many small tasks, also known as <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide/In_depth\">micro tasks</a>, rather than larger, more time consuming tasks.</p>\n<p>Asynchronous loading helps prevent pages and user interfaces from appearing to be (or actually becoming) unresponsive. By minimizing the time required for any individual loading task, the application's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide/In_depth#event_loops\">event loop</a> will continue to cycle while it starts up. This will prevent the application, browser, and/or device from appearing frozen.</p>\n<p>In the worst case, blocking the main thread can cause users to uninstall your app; for example, if someone launches your app by mistake and they aren't prevented from closing the application, they may want to take action so that doesn't accidentally happen again.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"where_theres_a_will…","title":"Where there's a will…","isH3":false,"content":"<p>It is easier to just write everything the \"right way\" the first time then it is to retrofit for performance (and accessibility). When you are starting from scratch, making appropriate bits of code asynchronous means a retrofit isn't necessary. All pure startup calculations should be performed in background threads, while you keep the run-time of main thread events as short as possible. Instead of including a progress indicator so the user knows what's going on and how long they'll be waiting, make the progress bar unnecessary.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, porting an existing app to the Web can be challenging. Native application don't need to be written in an asynchronous fashion because the operating system usually handles loading for you. The source application might have a main loop that can easily be made to operate asynchronously (by running each main loop iteration separately); startup is often just a continuous, monolithic procedure that might periodically update a progress meter.</p>\n<p>While you can use <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">Web workers</a> to run even very large, long-duration chunks of <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a> code asynchronously, there's a huge caveat: Web workers can't directly manipulate the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model\">DOM</a> and have limited access to methods and properties of the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\">window</a> object, including no access to <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API\">WebGL</a>. This all means that unless you can easily pull out the \"pure calculation\" chunks of your startup process into workers, you'll wind up having to run most or all of your startup code on the main thread.</p>\n<p>However, even code like that can be made asynchronous, with a little work.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"getting_asynchronous","title":"Getting asynchronous","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Here are some suggestions for how to build your startup process to be as asynchronous as possible (whether it's a new app or a port):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Use the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#defer\"><code>defer</code></a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#async\"><code>async</code></a> attribute on script tags needed by the Web application.

The provided one is almost certainly significantly faster, and will reduce your app size to boot. In addition, the browser may automatically parallelize these decoders.</li>\n  <li>Any data processing that can be done in parallel should be. Don't do one chunk of data after another; do them all at once when possible!</li>\n  <li>Don't include scripts or stylesheets that don't participate in the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path\">critical rendering path</a> in your startup HTML file. Load them only when needed.</li>\n  <li>Reduce the size of your JavaScript files. Try to send the minified version of the file to the browser and use compression like Gzip or Brotli.</li>\n  <li>Utilize resource hints (like preconnect or preload) whenever possible to indicate to the browser which files are more critical for your application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more stuff you can do asynchronously, the better advantage your app can take of multicore processors.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"porting_issues","title":"Porting issues","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Once the initial loading is done and the app's main code starts to run, it's possible your app has to be single-threaded, especially if it's a port. The most important thing to do to try to help with the main code's startup process is to refactor the code into small pieces. These can then be executed in chunks interspersed across multiple calls to your app's main loop (so that the main thread gets to handle input and the like).</p>\n<p>Emscripten provides an API to help with this refactoring; for example, you can use <code>emscripten_push_main_loop_blocker()</code> to establish a function to be executed before the main thread is allowed to continue. By establishing a queue of functions to be called in sequence, you can more easily manage running bits of code without blocking the main thread.</p>\n<p>That leaves, though, the problem of having to refactor your existing code to actually work that way.
