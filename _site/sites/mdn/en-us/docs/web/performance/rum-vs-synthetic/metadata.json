RUM and synthetic monitoring provide for different views of performance and have benefits, good use cases and shortfalls. RUM is generally best suited for understanding long-term trends whereas synthetic monitoring is very well suited to regression testing and mitigating shorter-term performance issues during development. In this article we define and compare these two performance monitoring approaches.","popularity":0.0015,"modified":"2023-07-04T10:01:14.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/performance/rum-vs-synthetic","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/performance/rum-vs-synthetic/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e74627e6fd9ba19696b918c2bdddfff8aa160787","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance","title":"Web performance"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic","title":"Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring"}],"pageTitle":"Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring - Web performance | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"2579fc17cb466cd8f2f63bcf19616bc12c2e0774e059a048945a08cb02059a4c"}
