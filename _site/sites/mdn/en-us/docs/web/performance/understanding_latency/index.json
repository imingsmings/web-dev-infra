On a first request, for the first 14Kb bytes, latency is longer because it includes a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS\">DNS</a> lookup, a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake\">TCP handshake</a>, the secure <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS\">TLS</a> negotiation. Subsequent requests will have less latency because the connection to the server is already set.</p>\n<p>Latency describes the amount of delay on a network or Internet connection. Low latency implies that there are no or almost no delays. High latency implies that there are many delays. One of the main aims of improving performance is to reduce latency.</p>\n<p>The latency associated with a single asset, especially a basic HTML page, may seem trivial. But websites generally involve multiple requests: the HTML includes requests for multiple CSS, scripts, and media files. The greater the number and size of these requests, the greater the impact of high latency on user experience.</p>\n<p>On a connection with low latency, requested resources will appear almost immediately. On a connection with high latency, there will be a discernible delay between the time that a request is sent, and the resources are returned. We can determine the amount of latency by measuring the speed with which the data moves from one network location to another.</p>\n<p>Latency can be measured one way, for example, the amount of time it takes to send a request for resources, or the length of the entire round-trip from the browser's request for a resource to the moment when the requested resource arrives at the browser.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"network_throttling","title":"Network throttling","isH3":false,"content":"<p>To emulate the latency of a low bandwidth network, you can use developer tools and switch to a lower end network connection.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency/emulate_latency.png\" alt=\"Emulate latency by emulating throttling\" width=\"829\" height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>In the developer tools, under the network table, you can switch the throttling option to 2G, 3G, etc. Different browser developer tools have different preset options, the characteristics emulated include download speed, upload speed, and minimum latency, or the minimum amount of time it takes to send a packet of data.
