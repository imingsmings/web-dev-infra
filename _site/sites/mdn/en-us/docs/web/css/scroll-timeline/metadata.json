The starting scroll position represents 0% progress and the ending scroll position represents 100% progress. If the 0% position and 100% position coincide (i.e., the scroll container has no overflow to scroll), the timeline is inactive.","popularity":0.0153,"modified":"2023-06-28T15:03:49.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/scroll-timeline","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/scroll-timeline/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/7eaac8008ebe00417314379fab2285df23322e73","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"scroll-timeline","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-timeline","title":"scroll-timeline"}],"pageTitle":"scroll-timeline - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"48e4cc308befd7e830246c86ca0d8e42bb3e2a305259bc58af65291df4e6649c"}
