Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. For example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous. With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.","popularity":0.1007,"modified":"2023-11-20T15:37:12.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/css_transitions/using_css_transitions","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/css_transitions/using_css_transitions/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/bed59f268d5e299beb538e435f08c4f4ce685980","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using CSS transitions","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions","title":"CSS transitions"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions","title":"Using CSS transitions"}],"pageTitle":"Using CSS transitions - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f4ed5863441bb50eaa4078506a67909bd4d5f1aabb8324bdc3e3df6f32cbeb14"}
