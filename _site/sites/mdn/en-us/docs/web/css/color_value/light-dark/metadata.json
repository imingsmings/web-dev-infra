The light-dark() function enables providing two color values where any <color> value is accepted. The light-dark() CSS color function returns the first value if the user's preference is set to light or if no preference is set and the second value if the user's preference is set to dark.","popularity":0.0053,"modified":"2023-11-25T08:53:03.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/color_value/light-dark","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/color_value/light-dark/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e1fe6bef090d700b63dae5da44b53ca603fcc6c1","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"light-dark()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value","title":"<color>"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark","title":"light-dark()"}],"pageTitle":"light-dark() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"b15b7cb06794136026f7b7432a81e043261672b345a1b0546824d236103fd095"}
