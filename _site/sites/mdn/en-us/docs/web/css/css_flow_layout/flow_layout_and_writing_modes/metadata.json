This can be used to properly typeset vertical languages or for creative reasons. CSS is making this easier by way of introducing logical properties and values so that when working in a vertical writing mode sizing can be based on element's inline and block size. This will be useful when creating components which can work in different writing-modes.","popularity":0.0015,"modified":"2023-07-17T22:37:27.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/css_flow_layout/flow_layout_and_writing_modes","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/css_flow_layout/flow_layout_and_writing_modes/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/856b52f634b889084869d2ee0b8bb62c084be04d","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Flow layout and writing modes","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout","title":"CSS flow layout"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout/Flow_layout_and_writing_modes","title":"Flow layout and writing modes"}],"pageTitle":"Flow layout and writing modes - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"29d0d4c267c65b35748e991eaf2387481257dfa2d3b57db9f3a82ae8344d5c55"}
