There is however the ability to wrap flex items onto new lines, creating new rows if flex-direction is row and new columns if flex-direction is column. In this guide I will explain how this works, what it is designed for and what situations really require CSS Grid Layout rather than flexbox.","popularity":0.0899,"modified":"2023-12-06T09:02:38.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/css_flexible_box_layout/mastering_wrapping_of_flex_items","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/css_flexible_box_layout/mastering_wrapping_of_flex_items/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/be1d7ab61bb423749ada43929215504d27181859","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Mastering wrapping of flex items","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout","title":"CSS flexible box layout"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Mastering_wrapping_of_flex_items","title":"Mastering wrapping of flex items"}],"pageTitle":"Mastering wrapping of flex items - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"96344b8c5d8ac0e2d37469dde63580e91a2f68f80535e0ed0a97ea34b5cdd6e7"}
