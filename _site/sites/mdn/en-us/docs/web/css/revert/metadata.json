Thus, it resets the property either to user agent set value, to user set value, to its inherited value (if it is inheritable), or to initial value. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property all.","popularity":0.014,"modified":"2023-07-14T22:09:47.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/revert","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/revert/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/2b24680f81617bedf2c655bbc62988b7ce73bcb6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"revert","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert","title":"revert"}],"pageTitle":"revert - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"3426cf62fec990a3324a1acf518fd6feb21a6564a5bf7d47be2cc40a463ca511"}
