Containment can also be used to scope CSS counters and quotes.","popularity":0.0269,"modified":"2023-07-17T22:37:27.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/contain","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/contain/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/856b52f634b889084869d2ee0b8bb62c084be04d","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"contain","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain","title":"contain"}],"pageTitle":"contain - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"54b0112e999e1e987d66eb8d0b3e0e963c2032ce70e564564924668bddfec97f"}
