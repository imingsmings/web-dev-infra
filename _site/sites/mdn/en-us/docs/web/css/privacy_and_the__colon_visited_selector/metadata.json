This was done through window.getComputedStyle and other techniques. This process was quick to execute, and made it possible not only to determine where the user had been on the web, but could also be used to guess a lot of information about the user's identity.","popularity":0.0015,"modified":"2023-02-21T06:10:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/privacy_and_the__colon_visited_selector","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/privacy_and_the__colon_visited_selector/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/9428e6f9ac2fd4166b5cf245fb674123209787ff","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Privacy and the :visited selector","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector","title":"Privacy and the :visited selector"}],"pageTitle":"Privacy and the :visited selector - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8070f6030493a179ef68e8fe6ff98fa6b51e1ee3bf4c5e6e2e1ddc2177918f5e"}
