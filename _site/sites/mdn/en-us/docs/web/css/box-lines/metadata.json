This process can repeat to an arbitrary number of lines. If a line contains only a single element that doesn't fit, then the element should stay on that line and overflow out of the box. The later lines are placed below the earlier lines in normal direction boxes and above in reverse direction boxes. The height of a line is the height of the largest child in that line. No additional space appears between the lines apart from the margins on the largest elements in each line. For calculating the height of a line, margins with a computed value of auto should be treated as having a value of 0.</p>\n  | <p>A similar process occurs for children in a vertical box. Later lines in normal direction boxes are placed to the right of earlier lines and to the left in reverse direction boxes.</p>\n> | <p>Once the number of lines has been determined, elements with a computed value for {{CSSxRef(\"box-flex\")}} other than <code>0</code> stretch as necessary in an attempt to fill the remaining space on the lines. Each line computes flexes independently, so only elements on that line are considered when evaluating {{CSSxRef(\"box-flex\")}} and {{CSSxRef(\"box-flex-groups\")}}. The packing of elements in a line, as specified by the {{CSSxRef(\"box-pack\")}} property, is also computed independently for each line.</p>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ^\n  | <h2>Syntax</h2>\n  | <pre class=\"brush: css\">/* Keyword values */","fatal":false,"filepath":"/Users/jason/Code/content/files/en-us/web/css/box-lines/index.md","macroSource":"{{CSSxRef(\"box-flex-groups\")}}"}]},"title":"box-lines","mdn_url":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-lines","locale":"en-US","native":"English (US)","browserCompat":["css.properties.box-lines"],"summary":"The box-lines CSS property determines whether the box may have a single or multiple lines (rows for horizontally oriented boxes, columns for vertically oriented boxes).","popularity":0.0025,"modified":"2023-07-20T07:38:29.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/box-lines","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/box-lines/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c77cfcd17e85db6c1b93160c70668f2ff6c2809c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"box-lines","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-lines","title":"box-lines"}],"pageTitle":"box-lines - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"fa9eb9d2e8f66db4cfc722b339845e48936a4af3ff8e0d1b05ce6e8ee305f2f8"}
