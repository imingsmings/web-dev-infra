In this guide, we are going to look at how these two things work together when we use named lines. Line naming is incredibly useful, but some of the more baffling looking grid syntax comes from this combination of names and track sizes. Once you work through some examples, it should become clearer and easier to work with.","popularity":0.0124,"modified":"2023-05-29T08:39:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/css_grid_layout/grid_layout_using_named_grid_lines","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/css_grid_layout/grid_layout_using_named_grid_lines/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/f79a491594ebb5634949ed31b26155973a39166e","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Layout using named grid lines","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout","title":"CSS grid layout"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_using_named_grid_lines","title":"Layout using named grid lines"}],"pageTitle":"Layout using named grid lines - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"d70f3d5f3a6a6aea6c8f977d356a81fa6051a9d2b66f9e8ba1df58ea00129ce4"}
