This is sometimes referred to as the text input cursor. The caret appears in elements such as <input> or those with the contenteditable attribute. The caret is typically a thin vertical line that flashes to help make it more noticeable. By default, it is black, but its color can be altered with this property.","popularity":0.0238,"modified":"2023-07-18T00:15:42.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/css/caret-color","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/caret-color/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/2adfb8760ac42c80966080e2e84211b14e43b589","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"caret-color","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS","title":"CSS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color","title":"caret-color"}],"pageTitle":"caret-color - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1033b8b5725243d7964ba21fc6116fd7648e0b6a16d236c4e16ad1a96418abcf"}
