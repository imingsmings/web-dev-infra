  <span>This is not red because it appears before any paragraph.</span>
  <p>Here is a paragraph.</p>
  <code>Here is some code.</code>
  <span>
    This span is red because it appears after the paragraph, even though there
    are other nodes in between.
  </span>
  <p>Whatever it may be, keep smiling.</p>
  <h1>Dream big</h1>
  <span>
    Doesn't matter how many or what kind of nodes are in between, all spans from
    the same parent after a paragraph are red.

</article>
<span>
  This span is not red because it doesn't share a parent with a paragraph.
