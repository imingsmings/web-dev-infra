Oh, Rubber Duckie, you're the one
You make bath time lots of fun
Rubber Duckie, I'm awfully fond of you

Rubber Duckie, joy of joys
When I squeeze you, you make noise
Rubber Duckie, you're my very best friend, it's true

Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby
I find a little fella who's cute and yellow and chubby
Rub-a-dub-dubby

<a href="#">Rubber Duckie</a>, you're so fine
And I'm lucky that you're mine
Rubber Duckie, I'm awfully fond of you
