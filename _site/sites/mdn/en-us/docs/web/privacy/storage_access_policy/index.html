That's because we document new aspects of the policy as soon as they land in <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly" class="external" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly</a>, our pre-release channel. Firefox Nightly may also contain experimental features that we don't yet plan to ship to Release users; experimental features will not be included in this documentation, but may nevertheless impact the functionality of domains classified as trackers.</p>

<p>Firefox uses the Tracking Protection list to determine which resources are tracking resources. The Tracking Protection list is <a href="https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection/issues" class="external" target="_blank">maintained by Disconnect</a>. When the list is applied in Firefox, we make two important changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, we only use the "Basic Protection" version of the list, which <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-prod-lists#disconnect-blacklistjson" class="external" target="_blank">excludes some categories of trackers</a>. In the future, we may expand our protections to use the "Strict Protection" version of the list.</li>
  <li>Second, Firefox uses an additional "<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-prod-lists/blob/master/disconnect-entitylist.json" class="external" target="_blank">entity list</a>", which prevents <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-prod-lists#disconnect-entitylistjson" class="external" target="_blank">domains from being classified as trackers when they are loaded on a top-level site owned by the same organization</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox uses the built-in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-tracking-protection" class="external" target="_blank">Tracking Protection</a> URL classifier to determine which resources match the tracking protection list. Domains are matched against the list in accordance with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/urls-hashing#suffixprefix-expressions" class="external" target="_blank">SafeBrowsing v4 specification</a>. Specifically, we check the exact hostname of the resource against the list, as well as the last four hostnames formed by starting with the last five components and successively removing the leading component. Consider the following examples:</p>
<figure class="table-container"><table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Hostname on the list</th>
      <th>Hostname of resource</th>
      <th>Matched</th>

Currently, Firefox includes some web compatibility heuristics that grant storage access to third-party resources classified as trackers when a user interacts with those third parties. We do this when we expect that not granting access would cause the web page to break. We also support an initial implementation of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">Storage Access API</a>, through which embedded <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>s can request storage access by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a>. Although both of these approaches provide the same level of storage access, we recommend third parties switch to using the Storage Access API in order to guarantee their access to storage.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="automatic_storage_access_upon_interaction"><h3 id="automatic_storage_access_upon_interaction"><a href="#automatic_storage_access_upon_interaction">Automatic storage access upon interaction</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>In order to improve web compatibility, Firefox currently includes some heuristics to grant storage access automatically to third parties that receive user interaction. These heuristics are intended to allow some third-party integrations that are common on the web to continue to function. They are intended to be temporary and will be removed in a future version of Firefox. They should not be relied upon for current and future web development.</p>
<p>Third-party storage access may be granted to resources that have been classified as tracking resources when a user gesture triggers a pop-up window that has <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener">opener access</a> to the originating document. When that occurs, there are three possible ways a third-party origin can be granted access:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The origin of the resource that is initially loaded in the pop-up window is granted storage access on the opener document if that origin has received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days.</li>
  <li>After the initial resource is loaded in the pop-up window, the window may go through a series of redirects to other hosts. If a user interacts with the pop-up window following a redirect, the origin of the content loaded in the pop-up window is given storage access on the opener document.</li>
  <li>When there is a top-level redirect from a tracking origin to a non-tracking origin, the tracking origin receives short-lived storage access on the non-tracking origin and any other non-tracking origins that appear further down the redirect chain (i.e., if the load continues to redirect). The tracking origin must have received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days, and the storage access permission expires after 15 minutes.</li>
</ul></div></section><section aria-labelledby="scope_of_storage_access"><h3 id="scope_of_storage_access"><a href="#scope_of_storage_access">Scope of storage access</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>When storage access is granted, it is scoped to the site of the opener document or subdomains of that origin. Access that is granted on the subdomain of an origin does extend to the top-level origin. As an example, if a resource from <code>tracker.example</code> is granted storage access on <code>foo.example.com</code>, then <code>tracker.example</code> will be able to access its cookies on <code>bar.foo.example.com</code> and on <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<p>When storage access is granted to <code>tracker.example</code> on <code>example.com</code>, all resources loaded from <code>tracker.example</code> on any top-level document loaded from <code>example.com</code> are immediately given storage access. This includes all resources loaded in the main context of the page, embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s, and resources loaded within embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s. Storage access is not extended to other resources loaded on <code>example.com</code> (e.g. <code>other-tracker.example</code>), nor to other first parties on which <code>tracker.example</code> is embedded (e.g. <code>example.org</code>).</p>
<p>Storage access grants extend into the first level of nested contexts, but no further. This means that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s embedded in the main context of the page and loaded from a domain classified as a tracker will have full access to all storage locations accessible through JavaScript. Similarly, requests for resources loaded in <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s embedded in the main context of the page will have access to HTTP cookies. However, further nested contexts, including but not limited to those from the origin classified as a tracker, will not be granted storage access.</p>
<p>Consider the following embedding scenarios on a top-level page loaded from <code>example.com</code> on which <code>tracker.example</code> has been granted storage access.</p>

Thus, the user may appear logged out to the service despite being logged in when they visit the provider's website directly. Depending on the type of integration, the user may have to take some action to interact with the social content provider before the provider is given access to their cookies. For example:</p>

  <li>For social login, the user may have to click a login button on the first party.</li>
  <li>For social like or share buttons, the user will have to first interact with the button in a logged-out state. Once they do, many social content providers will prompt them to log in.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these interactions, the provider will receive third-party storage access if they prompt the user in a way that is captured by the storage access activation heuristics described above. These providers should consider switching to explicitly request storage access through the Storage Access API as soon as possible. An <a href="https://bugzil.la/1469714" class="external" target="_blank">initial implementation of this API</a> is currently available in Nightly.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="i_use_third-party_pixels_and_other_tools_to_measure_the_effectiveness_of_my_ad_campaigns._will_i_still_be_able_to_measure_the_conversion_rate_of_my_ads"><h3 id="i_use_third-party_pixels_and_other_tools_to_measure_the_effectiveness_of_my_ad_campaigns._will_i_still_be_able_to_measure_the_conversion_rate_of_my_ads"><a href="#i_use_third-party_pixels_and_other_tools_to_measure_the_effectiveness_of_my_ad_campaigns._will_i_still_be_able_to_measure_the_conversion_rate_of_my_ads">I use third-party pixels and other tools to measure the effectiveness of my ad campaigns. Will I still be able to measure the conversion rate of my ads?</a></h3><div class="section-content"><p>This depends on how the third party has implemented the measurement tool, but generally ad conversion measurement will be more difficult. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You run an ad on a social media website that is seen several times by a user, but never clicked. That user later visits your website, which includes a conversion tracking tag from the same social media website. This type of conversion is often referred to as a "view-through conversion." Since the social media website does not have access to their third-party storage, they will not recognize the user as the same user that saw the advertisements on their website and the conversion will not be tracked. We expect that most view-through conversion tracking techniques will no longer work, including those offered by display networks.</li>
  <li>You run an ad on a display network or social media website that is clicked by a user. That user lands on your website, which includes a conversion tracking tag from the same website that displayed your ad. This type of conversion is often referred to as a "click-through conversion." Since the social media site or display network will not have access to their third-party storage, they will not recognize the user as the same user that saw the advertisements on their website and the conversion will not be tracked. We expect that this version of click-through conversion will no longer work.</li>
  <li>You run an ad that appears on a social media website. A user clicks on your advertisement and is taken to a landing page that contains a conversion tracking tag from the third-party network. On the social media website, the network annotates the advertisement landing page URL with a query parameter that signals that the visit was the result of a click on an advertisement. On your website, the display network's tag checks the URL query parameters and saves any ad tracking parameters to first-party storage. If a user later completes a conversion event, the network's tag checks first-party storage to determine which click (or clicks) was responsible for the visit. We expect that click-through conversion implemented in this way will continue to work.</li>
