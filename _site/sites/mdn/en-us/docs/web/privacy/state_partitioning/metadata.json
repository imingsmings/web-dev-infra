This effort aims to\n  achieve that by providing what is effectively a \"different\", isolated storage\n  location to every website a user visits. This article gives an overview of\n  the mechanism, lists the affected APIs and explains how to debug affected\n  sites.","popularity":0.0102,"modified":"2023-07-24T23:45:00.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/privacy/state_partitioning","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/privacy/state_partitioning/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/6d606174faaedaa5dee7b7ebd87602cd51e5dd7e","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"State Partitioning","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy","title":"Privacy on the web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning","title":"State Partitioning"}],"pageTitle":"State Partitioning - Privacy on the web | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"82f4d0e0e9b5465925662915c9a91b9c18e35b13f5920528339c794872ddd6b0"}
