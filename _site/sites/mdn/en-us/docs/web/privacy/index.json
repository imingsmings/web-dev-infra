This can be done in a pretty granular way, for example by including <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noreferrer\">rel=\"noreferrer\"</a> on external links:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><p class=\"example-header\"><span class=\"language-name\">html</span></p><pre class=\"brush: html notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>/some/external/resource<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">rel</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>noreferrer<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>Or you could set this more globally for the page or site, for example by using the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy\"><code>Referrer-Policy</code></a> header.\n    <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect8\">\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> See also <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns\">Referer header: privacy and security concerns</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Use the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy\"><code>Permissions-Policy</code></a> HTTP header to control access to \"powerful features\" (such as notifications, geolocation data, accessing media streams from webcams, etc.). This can be useful for privacy because it stops third party sites from doing unexpected things with these features, and users don't want to be unnecessarily bombarded by permissions prompts that they may not understand.\n    The following example disables <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API\">Picture-in-Picture</a> everywhere, allows <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API\">Geolocation</a> to be used only on one specific origin, and allows camera usage everywhere:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><p class=\"example-header\"><span class=\"language-name\">http</span></p><pre class=\"brush: http notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token header\"><span class=\"token header-name keyword\">Permissions-Policy</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token header-value\">picture-in-picture=(), geolocation=(self https://example.com), camera=*;</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>To enable usage of \"powerful features\" inside third party sites embedded inside <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a> elements, you specify permissions policies inside an <code>allow</code> attributes. The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> equivalent of the above is as follows:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><p class=\"example-header\"><span class=\"language-name\">html</span></p><pre class=\"brush: html notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>iframe</span>\n  <span class=\"token attr-name\">src</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>https://example.com<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token attr-name\">allow</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>picture-in-picture 'none'; geolocation 'self' https://example.com; camera '*'<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>iframe</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n    <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect9\">\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> See also our <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy\">Permissions-Policy guide</a> for more information, and <a href=\"https://www.permissionspolicy.com/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">permissionspolicy.com</a> for useful tools including a policy generator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect10\">\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a> <code>sandbox</code> attribute also allows you to allow or disallow usage of certain features.</p>\n    </div>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect11\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> See <a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/privacy/third-parties/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Third parties</a> over on web.dev for additional useful information on auditing and more.</p>\n</div>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"protect_user_data","title":"Protect user data","isH3":false,"content":"<p>You need to make sure that, once you have collected data from your users, that it is transmitted and stored securely. This is more of a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Security\">security</a> topic, but it is worth mentioning here — a good privacy policy is no good if your security is lax and attackers can steal the data from you.</p>\n<p>The below tips offer some guidance on protecting your user's data:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Security is hard to get right. When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection — particularly if it is sensitive data such as log-in credentials — it makes sense to use a reputable solution from a well-respected provider. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose — for example an identity provider solution, or a secure online survey provider.</li>\n  <li>If you want to roll out your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand what you are doing. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API\">Web Authentication</a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API\">Federated Credential Management</a> to streamline the client-side of the app.</li>\n  <li>When collecting user sign-up information, enforce strong passwords so that your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. In addition, encourage your users to use a password manager so that they can use more complex passwords, without needing to worry remembering them, thereby avoiding a security risk by writing them down.</li>\n  <li>Don't include sensitive data in URLs — if a third party intercepts the URL (for example via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer\"><code>Referer</code></a> header), they could steal that information. Use <code>POST</code> requests rather than <code>GET</code> requests to avoid this.</li>\n  <li>Consider using tools like <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\">Content Security Policy</a> and <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy\">Permissions Policy</a> to enforce a set of feature usage on your site that makes it harder to introduce vulnerabilities. Be careful when doing this — if you block usage of a feature that a third party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality. This is something you can look into when auditing your third party resources (see <a href=\"#carefully_manage_third-party_resources\">Carefully manage third-party resources</a>).</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"see_also","title":"See also","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Security\">Web security</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/privacy/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Learn Privacy</a> on web.dev</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">The Privacy Sandbox</a> on developer.chrome.com</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/policy/lean-data/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Lean Data Practices</a> on mozilla.org</li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Defining privacy terms and concepts","id":"defining_privacy_terms_and_concepts"},{"text":"Privacy features provided by browsers","id":"privacy_features_provided_by_browsers"},{"text":"Privacy considerations for client-side developers","id":"privacy_considerations_for_client-side_developers"},{"text":"Collect data ethically","id":"collect_data_ethically"},{"text":"Cut down on tracking cookies","id":"cut_down_on_tracking_cookies"},{"text":"Protect user data","id":"protect_user_data"},{"text":"See also","id":"see_also"}],"summary":"People use websites for several important tasks such as banking, shopping, entertainment, and paying their taxes.
