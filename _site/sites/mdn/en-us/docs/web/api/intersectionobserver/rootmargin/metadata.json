Each side of the rectangle represented\n  by rootMargin is added to the corresponding side in the\n  root element's bounding box\n  before the intersection test is performed. This lets you, for example, adjust the bounds\n  outward so that the target element is considered 100% visible even if a certain number\n  of pixels worth of width or height is clipped away, or treat the target as partially\n  hidden if an edge is too close to the edge of the root's bounding box.","popularity":0.0115,"modified":"2023-04-07T06:06:41.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/intersectionobserver/rootmargin","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/intersectionobserver/rootmargin/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/eab4066e72d5478de920e4020e5db71214dcffa6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"rootMargin","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver","title":"IntersectionObserver"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin","title":"rootMargin"}],"pageTitle":"IntersectionObserver: rootMargin property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5a4ad8d84134f854493f0d7b256904a899bf72e1a7394d03dd568847591efe0b"}
