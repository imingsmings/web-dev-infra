We'll be using the getUserMedia() method on the navigator.mediaDevices object.\n  The getUserMedia() endpoint takes a constraints object that specifies which permissions are needed. getUserMedia() is a promise which, when successfully resolved, returns a MediaStream object. In our case this is going to contain the audio from our stream. If the promise isn't successfully resolved, you'll want to catch and display the error.","popularity":0.0082,"modified":"2023-05-03T02:24:26.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webrtc_api/build_a_phone_with_peerjs/connect_peers/get_microphone_permission","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webrtc_api/build_a_phone_with_peerjs/connect_peers/get_microphone_permission/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c2274293475b0a5b4febf85a49c1f91bf43ebac7","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Getting browser microphone permission","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API","title":"WebRTC API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Build_a_phone_with_peerjs","title":"Building an Internet-Connected Phone with PeerJS"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Build_a_phone_with_peerjs/Connect_peers","title":"Connecting the peers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Build_a_phone_with_peerjs/Connect_peers/Get_microphone_permission","title":"Getting browser microphone permission"}],"pageTitle":"Getting browser microphone permission - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"c48b6265655e22a194c71add33065d2aacb37e6904a7c6aa127c9d0d33b99a36"}
