This problem can be solved to a degree via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API\" title=\"History API\">History API</a>, but it is not designed for the needs of SPAs. The Navigation API aims to bridge that gap.</p>\n<p>The API is accessed via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigation\"><code>Window.navigation</code></a> property, which returns a reference to a global <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation\"><code>Navigation</code></a> object.

This is fired when <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api#appendix-types-of-navigations\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">any type of navigation</a> is initiated, meaning that you can control all page navigations from one central place, ideal for routing functionality in SPA frameworks. (This is not the case with the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API\" title=\"History API\">History API</a>, where it is sometimes hard to figure out responding to all navigations.) The <code>navigate</code> event handler is passed a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigateEvent\"><code>NavigateEvent</code></a> object, which contains detailed information including details around the navigation's destination, type, whether it contains <code>POST</code> form data or a download request, and more.</p>\n<p>The <code>NavigationEvent</code> object also provides two methods:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigateEvent/intercept\" title=\"intercept()\"><code>intercept()</code></a> takes as an argument a callback handler function returning a promise. It allows you to control what happens when the navigation is initiated.

If it rejects, meaning the navigation has failed, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigateerror_event\" title=\"navigateerror\"><code>navigateerror</code></a> fires instead, allowing you to gracefully handle the failure case. There is also a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationTransition/finished\" title=\"finished\"><code>finished</code></a> property on the <code>NavigationTransition</code> object, which fulfills or rejects at the same time as the aforementioned events are fired, providing another path for handling the success and failure cases.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect4\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before the Navigation API was available, to do something similar you'd have to listen for all click events on links, run <code>e.preventDefault()</code>, perform the appropriate <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState\"><code>History.pushState()</code></a> call, then set up the page view based on the new URL.

Each history entry is represented by a distinct <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationHistoryEntry\"><code>NavigationHistoryEntry</code></a> object instance. These contain several properties such as the entry's key, URL, and state information. You can get the entry that the user is currently on right now using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/currentEntry\"><code>Navigation.currentEntry</code></a>, and an array of all existing history entries using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/entries\"><code>Navigation.entries()</code></a>.

This is developer-defined information — it can be whatever you like. For example, you might want to store a <code>visitCount</code> property that records the number of times a view has been visited, or an object containing multiple properties related to UI state, so that state can be restored when a user returns to that view.</p>\n<p>To get a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationHistoryEntry\"><code>NavigationHistoryEntry</code></a>'s state, you call its <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationHistoryEntry/getState\" title=\"getState()\"><code>getState()</code></a> method. It is initially <code>undefined</code>, but when state information is set on the entry, it will return the previously-set state information.</p>\n<p>Setting state is a bit more nuanced. You can't retrieve the state value and then update it directly — the copy stored on the entry will not change. Instead, you update it while performing a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate\" title=\"navigate()\"><code>navigate()</code></a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/reload\" title=\"reload()\"><code>reload()</code></a> — each one of these optionally takes an options object parameter, which includes a <code>state</code> property containing the new state to set on the history entry. When these navigations commit, the state change will be automatically applied.</p>\n<p>In some cases however, a state change will be independent from a navigation or reload — for example when a page contains an expandable/collapsible <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details\"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code></a> element. In this case, you might want to store the expanded/collapsed state in your history entry, so you can restore it when the user returns to the page or restarts their browser. Cases like this are handled using <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/updateCurrentEntry\"><code>Navigation.updateCurrentEntry()</code></a>. The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/currententrychange_event\" title=\"currententrychange\"><code>currententrychange</code></a> will fire when the current entry change is complete.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"limitations","title":"Limitations","isH3":true,"content":"<p>There are a few perceived limitations with the Navigation API:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The current specification doesn't trigger a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation/navigate_event\" title=\"navigate\"><code>navigate</code></a> event on a page's first load. This might be fine for sites that use Server Side Rendering (SSR)—your server could return the correct initial state, which is the fastest way to get content to your users. But sites that leverage client-side code to create their pages may need an additional function to initialize the page.</li>\n  <li>The Navigation API operates only within a single frame—the top-level page, or a single specific <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe\"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>. This has some interesting implications that are <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api#warning-backforward-are-not-always-opposites\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">further documented in the spec</a>, but in practice, will reduce developer confusion. The previous <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API\" title=\"History API\">History API</a> has several confusing edge cases, like support for frames, which the Navigation API handles up-front.</li>\n  <li>You can't currently use the Navigation API to programmatically modify or rearrange the history list. It might be useful to have a temporary state, for example navigating the user to a temporary modal that asks them for some information, then going back to the previous URL.
