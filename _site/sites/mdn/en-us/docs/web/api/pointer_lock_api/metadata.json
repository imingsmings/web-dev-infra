It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first-person 3D games, for example.","popularity":0.0088,"modified":"2023-03-01T09:58:07.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/pointer_lock_api","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/pointer_lock_api/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c244d3b2cb6c17e6ba8692e3faec393afd9988ca","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Pointer Lock API","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API","title":"Pointer Lock API"}],"pageTitle":"Pointer Lock API - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"325b28dcf6e8ca7fa87c0293aa0627cdfe590820a80d91d8b5e6acd38f2509e0"}
