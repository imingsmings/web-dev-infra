This is in contrast to <em>partitioned cookies</em>, where embedded resources under each top-level site are given a unique cookie storage space (see for example <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Partitioned_cookies\">Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS)</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Storage Access API is relevant to user agents that by default block access to unpartitioned cookies by sites loaded in a third-party context to improve privacy (for example, to prevent tracking). There are legitimate uses for unpartitioned cookie access by third-party content that we still want to enable, even with these default restrictions in place. Examples include SSO with federated IdPs, or persisting user details such as location data or viewing preferences across different sites.</p>\n<p>The API provides methods that allow embedded resources to check whether they currently have access to unpartitioned cookies and, if not, to request access from the user agent.</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect2\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>Storage Access API</em> name may seem like somewhat of a misnomer, given that it only provides access to cookies, and not other client-side storage mechanisms such as <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API\" title=\"Web Storage\">Web Storage</a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API\" title=\"IndexedDB\">IndexedDB</a>.

These range from giving embedded resources under each top-level origin a unique cookie storage space (<em>partitioned cookies</em>), to outright blocking of cookie access when resources are loaded in a third-party context.</p>\n<p>The semantics around unpartitioned cookie blocking features/policies differ from browser to browser, but the core functionality is similar: cross-site resources embedded in a third-party context are not given access to the same cookies that they would have access to when loaded in a first-party context. This is done with good intent — browser vendors want to take steps to better protect their user's privacy and security, for example leaving them less open to having their activity tracked across different sites, and less vulnerable to exploits such as cross-site request forgery (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF\">CSRF</a>).</p>\n<p>However, there are legitimate uses for embedded cross-site content accessing unpartitioned cookies, which the above features/policies are known to break. As an example, federated logins often require access to authentication cookies, and will require the user to sign in on each site separately (or completely break) if those cookies are not available. As a result, site owners often encourage users to add their site as an exception or to disable such policies entirely. Users who wish to continue to interact with embedded content are forced to greatly relax their blocking policy for resources loaded from all embedded origins and possibly across all websites.</p>\n<p>The Storage Access API is intended to solve this problem; embedded cross-site content can request unrestricted access to unpartitioned cookies on a frame-by-frame basis, for a particular top-level embedding site, via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess\"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a> method. It can also check whether it already has access via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hasStorageAccess\"><code>Document.hasStorageAccess()</code></a> method.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"how_it_works","title":"How it works","isH3":false,"content":"<p>As explained above, modern browsers implement various features and policies to restrict or block access to unpartitioned cookies by embedded content. Such content that has a legitimate need for cookie access can get around this problem using the Storage Access API as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>It can call the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hasStorageAccess\"><code>Document.hasStorageAccess()</code></a> method to check whether it has the access it needs already.</li>\n  <li>If not, it can request access via the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess\"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a> method.</li>\n  <li>Depending on the browser, the user will be asked whether to grant access to the requesting embed in slightly different ways.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Safari shows prompts for all embedded content that has not previously received storage access.</li>\n      <li>Firefox only prompts users after an origin has requested storage access on more than a threshold number of sites.</li>\n      <li>At the time of writing, Chrome doesn't prompt the user. Instead, it only resolves <code>requestStorageAccess()</code> calls that come from domains within a <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/first-party-sets/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">first-party set</a>. This behavior will change as the implementation is developed further.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Access is granted or denied based on whether the content meets all the security requirements (see <a href=\"#security_measures\">Security measures</a>, below). The <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promise</code></a>-based nature of <code>requestStorageAccess()</code> allows you to run code to handle success and failure cases.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Modern spec behavior dictates that access is granted <strong>per-frame</strong> — every separate content embed has its unpartitioned cookie access blocked by default, and needs to call <code>requestStorageAccess()</code> to opt-in to access. If a content embed has received access, and same-site embeds then call <code>requestStorageAccess()</code>, their promises will fulfill automatically. But they still need to opt-in.</li>\n      <li>In older versions of the spec, the access was <strong>per-page</strong>. As soon as one embed received unpartitioned cookie access via <code>requestStorageAccess()</code>, all other same-site embeds would automatically receive access. This was not desirable behavior from a security standpoint — for example, if <code>shop.example.com</code> embedded <code>locator.users.com</code> to allow users to use their location info while shopping, and <code>locator.users.com</code> called <code>requestStorageAccess()</code>, <code>shop.example.com</code> and any other sites it embeds would be able to access its cookies, but also access cookies from <code>private.users.com</code>, which is not intended to be embedded. <a href=\"https://github.com/privacycg/storage-access/issues/113\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about the motivations</a> behind this change.</li>\n      <li>Consult the <a href=\"#browser_compatibility\">Browser compatibility information</a> to see which browsers implement which behavior.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Once access is granted, a permission key is stored in the browser with the structure <code>&lt;top-level site, embedded site&gt;</code>. For example, if the embedding site is <code>embedder.com</code>, and the embed is <code>locator.example.com</code>, the key would be <code>&lt;embedder.com, example.com&gt;</code>. Same-site embeds (<code>docs.example.com</code>, <code>profile.example.com</code>, etc.) would then be able to call <code>requestStorageAccess()</code> and the promise would fulfill automatically, as mentioned earlier.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Older versions of the spec used the more specific permission key structure <code>&lt;top-level site, embedded origin&gt;</code>, which meant that same-site, cross-origin embeds didn't match the permission key and had to go through the whole process separately.</li>\n      <li>At the time of writing, only Chromium browsers had implemented the new behavior.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect3\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The only exception to the \"blocked by default\" behavior is when a content embed makes a successful <code>requestStorageAccess()</code>, but then performs a same-origin navigation (for example reloading itself). In such cases, the storage access is carried over from the previous navigation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect4\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In cases where a top-level site has its cookies partitioned (for example via <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Partitioned_cookies\">CHIPS</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-androids-new-privacy-feature-total-cookie-protection-stops-companies-from-keeping-tabs-on-your-moves/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Total Cookie Protection</a>), the Storage Access API isn't required, as sharing the cookies by default has no privacy risk.</p>\n</div>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"security_measures","title":"Security measures","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Several different security measures could cause a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess\"><code>Document.requestStorageAccess()</code></a> call to fail.
