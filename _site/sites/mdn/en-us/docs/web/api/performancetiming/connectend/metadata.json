If the\n  transport layer reports an error and the connection establishment is started again, the\n  last connection establishment end time is given. If a persistent connection is used, the\n  value will be the same as PerformanceTiming.fetchStart. A connection is\n  considered as opened when all secure connection handshake, or SOCKS authentication, is\n  terminated.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-04-07T19:46:21.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/performancetiming/connectend","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/performancetiming/connectend/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c58e8c1dd6ecbcb63894c7dd17fb9495b9511b4e","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"connectEnd","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming","title":"PerformanceTiming"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/connectEnd","title":"connectEnd"}],"pageTitle":"PerformanceTiming: connectEnd property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0a0f4d7f8a35ada33895e445a087456245a2d29c74d05d75490ad9804645ffc3"}
