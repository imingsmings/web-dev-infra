In other words, any time it stops running without sending an animationend event. This might happen when the animation-name is changed such that the animation is removed, or when the animating node is hidden using CSS. Therefore, either directly or because any of its containing nodes are hidden.","popularity":0.0013,"modified":"2023-07-18T16:15:49.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/element/animationcancel_event","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/element/animationcancel_event/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/1b094710cd2816a6669ce616b6f56d0a5b25e6ad","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"animationcancel","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element","title":"Element"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationcancel_event","title":"animationcancel"}],"pageTitle":"Element: animationcancel event - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8574939d92da7b7b33d82d60f5c47f3724205782785283fd819bee26e26f049a"}
