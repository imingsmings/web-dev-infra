The callback can call this method at\n  any time to determine how much time it can continue to work before it must return. For\n  example, if the callback finishes a task and has another one to begin, it can call\n  timeRemaining() to see if there's enough time to complete the next task. If\n  there isn't, the callback can just return immediately, or look for other work to do with\n  the remaining time.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-04-07T06:06:41.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/idledeadline/timeremaining","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/idledeadline/timeremaining/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/eab4066e72d5478de920e4020e5db71214dcffa6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"timeRemaining()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDeadline","title":"IdleDeadline"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDeadline/timeRemaining","title":"timeRemaining()"}],"pageTitle":"IdleDeadline: timeRemaining() method - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8a01f8892103704571b6e74426fc3a626f01a6327f58704129a4b09a4e0582e2"}
