However, devices with touch screens (especially portable devices) are mainstream and Web applications can either directly process touch-based input by using Touch Events or the application can use interpreted mouse events for the application input. A disadvantage to using mouse events is that they do not support concurrent user input, whereas touch events support multiple simultaneous inputs (possibly at different locations on the touch surface), thus enhancing user experiences.","popularity":0.0186,"modified":"2023-12-06T09:03:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/touch_events/using_touch_events","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/touch_events/using_touch_events/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/dc81f892193e3af5b4c4e7e1d44d774e13ba62c6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using Touch Events","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events","title":"Touch events"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events","title":"Using Touch Events"}],"pageTitle":"Using Touch Events - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1d2cedf910db01508ec9117094a0e245d2fc708229e7bcd04d3f9c36c66df68d"}
