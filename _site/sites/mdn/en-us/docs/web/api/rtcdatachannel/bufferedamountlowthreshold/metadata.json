When the number of buffered outgoing bytes, as indicated by the\n  bufferedAmount property, falls to or\n  below this value, a bufferedamountlow event is fired. This event may be\n  used, for example, to implement code which queues more messages to be sent whenever\n  there's room to buffer them. Listeners may be added with\n  onbufferedamountlow or\n  addEventListener().","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-04-07T19:50:09.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/rtcdatachannel/bufferedamountlowthreshold","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/rtcdatachannel/bufferedamountlowthreshold/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/954612667bafd71241a93e8554e8f11afc474ff3","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"bufferedAmountLowThreshold","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel","title":"RTCDataChannel"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel/bufferedAmountLowThreshold","title":"bufferedAmountLowThreshold"}],"pageTitle":"RTCDataChannel: bufferedAmountLowThreshold property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"2925b41cff673665b166072df9a4d2535926a44fe04bfc512a4568382e893249"}
