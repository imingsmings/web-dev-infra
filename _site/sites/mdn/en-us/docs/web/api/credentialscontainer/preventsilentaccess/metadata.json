For\n  example, you might call this, after a user signs out of a website to ensure that\n  they aren't automatically signed in on the next site visit. Mediation varies by origin,\n  and is an added check point of browser stored credentials, informing a user of an\n  account login status. This method is typically called after a user signs out of a\n  website, ensuring this user's login information is not automatically passed on the next\n  site visit.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-04-07T05:46:57.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/credentialscontainer/preventsilentaccess","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/credentialscontainer/preventsilentaccess/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/d76defab4ca13261e9de81ae1df125345f847b0a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"preventSilentAccess()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer","title":"CredentialsContainer"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/preventSilentAccess","title":"preventSilentAccess()"}],"pageTitle":"CredentialsContainer: preventSilentAccess() method - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"23ffe7fb09cd199d49fc1ef7b365c5758ee9f67caa42697ae04e0ad3310d25cf"}
