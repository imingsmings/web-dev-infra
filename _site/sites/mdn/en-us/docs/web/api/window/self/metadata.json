It can be used with dot notation on a window object (that is, window.self) or standalone (self). The advantage of the standalone notation is that a similar notation exists for non-window contexts, such as in Web Workers. By using self, you can refer to the global scope in a way that will work not only in a window context (self will resolve to window.self) but also in a worker context (self will then resolve to WorkerGlobalScope.self).","popularity":0.0047,"modified":"2023-04-08T06:57:07.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/window/self","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/window/self/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/cc070123f72376faec06e36622c4fc723a75325f","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"self","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window","title":"Window"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self","title":"self"}],"pageTitle":"Window: self property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"a43080c73e8912a3ce38a7e0f40959ef734dcc0a55202db410c7d7fee0a7d256"}
