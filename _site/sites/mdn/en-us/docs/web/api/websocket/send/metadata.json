If the\n  data can't be sent (for example, because it needs to be buffered but the buffer is\n  full), the socket is closed automatically.\n  The browser will throw an exception if you call send() when the connection is in the CONNECTING state. If you call send() when the connection is in the CLOSING or CLOSED states, the browser will silently discard the data.","popularity":0.0229,"modified":"2023-08-18T22:42:32.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/websocket/send","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/websocket/send/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/6a0f22ee0b3a854ed37271373cbc1d1099c0d361","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"send()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket","title":"WebSocket"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send","title":"send()"}],"pageTitle":"WebSocket: send() method - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"b5d331994aba4808cc34d8ce2bdc15be367b62894c4aed458427c6fd85d0f29a"}
