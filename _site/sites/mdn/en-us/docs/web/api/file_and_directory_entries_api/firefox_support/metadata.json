Work to standardize the specification was abandoned back in 2012, but by that point, Google Chrome included its own implementation of the API. Over time, a number of popular sites and Web applications came to use it, often without providing any means of falling back to standard APIs or even checking to be sure the API is available before using it. Mozilla instead opted to implement other APIs which can be used to solve many of the same problems, such as IndexedDB; see the blog post Why no FileSystem API in Firefox? for more insights.","popularity":0.001,"modified":"2023-02-24T12:04:34.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/file_and_directory_entries_api/firefox_support","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/file_and_directory_entries_api/firefox_support/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/0444ab41bb372e63b3345f50e5b1e4e6a96c21d5","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"File and Directory Entries API support in Firefox","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API","title":"File and Directory Entries API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API/Firefox_support","title":"File and Directory Entries API support in Firefox"}],"pageTitle":"File and Directory Entries API support in Firefox - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"865de06dcac568ffb54693b367337ad32c1dfbce1a16c2481fe9be5fc00f63d7"}
