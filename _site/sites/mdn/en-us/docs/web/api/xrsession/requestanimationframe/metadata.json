The specified callback is executed once before the next repaint; if\n  you wish for it to be executed for the following repaint, you must\n  call requestAnimationFrame() again. This can be done from within the\n  callback itself.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/xrsession/requestanimationframe","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/xrsession/requestanimationframe/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"requestAnimationFrame()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession","title":"XRSession"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/requestAnimationFrame","title":"requestAnimationFrame()"}],"pageTitle":"XRSession: requestAnimationFrame() method - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"a695cf0b06294aef1ded4c1148067942754cf559a1128c13bce47ee7b689c555"}
