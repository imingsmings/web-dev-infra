Note that if the target element is removed from the document, events will still be targeted at it, and hence won't necessarily bubble up to the window or document anymore. If there is any risk of an element being removed while it is being touched, the best practice is to attach the touch listeners directly to the target.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/touch/target","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/touch/target/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"target","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch","title":"Touch"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch/target","title":"target"}],"pageTitle":"Touch: target property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f16c8a89ddb3696e2101681beb406146f52af3e70f721b94402e5bfd33d69b50"}
