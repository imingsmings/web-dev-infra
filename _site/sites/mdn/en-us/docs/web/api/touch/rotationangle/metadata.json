The value may be between 0 and 90. Together, these three values describe an ellipse that approximates the size and shape of the area of contact between the user and the screen. This may be a relatively large ellipse representing the contact between a fingertip and the screen or a small area representing the tip of a stylus, for example.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-04-08T06:16:25.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/touch/rotationangle","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/touch/rotationangle/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/0c8a320b035cf625c1df67713a94ead2e7f3aec6","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"rotationAngle","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch","title":"Touch"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch/rotationAngle","title":"rotationAngle"}],"pageTitle":"Touch: rotationAngle property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"74f304d3c00a5af7544bb554f45a684bfbcd7ceda04cdcfab3edaf8e5cd9636a"}
