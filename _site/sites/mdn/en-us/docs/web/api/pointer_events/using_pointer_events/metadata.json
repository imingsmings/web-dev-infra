This example is based on the one in the touch events overview, except it uses the pointer events input event model. Another difference is that because pointer events are pointer device agnostic, the application accepts coordinate-based inputs from a mouse, a pen, or a fingertip using the same code.","popularity":0.0021,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/pointer_events/using_pointer_events","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/pointer_events/using_pointer_events/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using Pointer Events","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events","title":"Pointer events"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events/Using_Pointer_Events","title":"Using Pointer Events"}],"pageTitle":"Using Pointer Events - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1737e0d7275f733fefd0612408c858f0fc8b6bb1dde915a0f63782387f5b3406"}
