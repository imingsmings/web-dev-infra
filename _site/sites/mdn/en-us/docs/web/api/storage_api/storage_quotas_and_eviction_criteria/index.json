If the user has saved it as a web app on the Home Screen or the Dock, this limit is increased to up to 60% of the disk size. For privacy reasons, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy\">cross-origin</a> frames have a separate quota, amounting to roughly 1/10 of their parents.</p>\n<p>For instance, a macOS device with a 1 TiB drive will limit each origin to around 200 GiB. If the user stores a web app on its Dock, that will be alloted a greater limit of around 600 GiB.</p>\n<p>Like other browsers, the exact limits enforced by the quota may vary as to avoid fingerprinting. Additionally, Safari also enforces an overall quota that stored data across all origins cannot grow beyond: 80% of disk size for each browser and web app, and 15% of disk size for each non-browser app that displays web content. More info on Safari's storage policies can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.webkit.org/blog/14403/updates-to-storage-policy/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Webkit blog</a>.</p>\n<p>In earlier versions of Safari, an origin is given an initial 1 GiB quota. Once the origin reaches this limit, Safari asks the user for permission to let the origin store more data.
