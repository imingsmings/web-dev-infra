So it's important that code running in the page should not be able to accidentally break a custom element by modifying its internal implementation. Shadow DOM enables you to attach a DOM tree to an element, and have the internals of this tree hidden from JavaScript and CSS running in the page.","popularity":0.0839,"modified":"2023-10-13T19:44:05.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/web_components/using_shadow_dom","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/web_components/using_shadow_dom/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4cc4cc8b3a6ff7889ac62b52e035bb4c174b31b4","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using shadow DOM","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components","title":"Web Components"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM","title":"Using shadow DOM"}],"pageTitle":"Using shadow DOM - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"7651b2b83e9d806a60e3e5a83cd72c0bd7ad6ef68f6cb028472188393b1729b0"}
