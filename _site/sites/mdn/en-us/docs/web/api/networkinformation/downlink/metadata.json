This\n  value is based on recently observed application layer throughput across recently active\n  connections, excluding connections made to a private address space. In the absence of\n  recent bandwidth measurement data, the attribute value is determined by the properties\n  of the underlying connection technology.","popularity":0.0028,"modified":"2023-04-07T06:16:45.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/networkinformation/downlink","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/networkinformation/downlink/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ef75c1741b450c2331204be5563ee964ad5f4c48","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"downlink","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation","title":"NetworkInformation"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/downlink","title":"downlink"}],"pageTitle":"NetworkInformation: downlink property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"eaf77265422dfd523a4b358368157aa5f0580a57c1940bd0d47a9127c7b876d5"}
