The high resolution timers are needed for accurate benchmarking instead of the less precise and non-monotonic Date timestamps.","popularity":0.0037,"modified":"2023-09-05T06:28:25.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/performance_api/high_precision_timing","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/performance_api/high_precision_timing/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/27c5383cd85224527db828234ba454cb07aeca0a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"High precision timing","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API","title":"Performance API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/High_precision_timing","title":"High precision timing"}],"pageTitle":"High precision timing - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"d0c68161d6eeb00376de7062bf465bb8843976efc589ee1e3f4f97c6068d0b7d"}
