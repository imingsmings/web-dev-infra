Unlike DeviceMotionEvent.acceleration\n  which compensates for the influence of gravity, its value is the sum of the acceleration\n  of the device as induced by the user and an acceleration equal and opposite to that\n  caused by gravity. In other words, it measures the\n  g-force. In practice, this value represents\n  the raw data measured by an accelerometer.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-04-07T05:49:06.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/devicemotionevent/accelerationincludinggravity","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/devicemotionevent/accelerationincludinggravity/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/53b1989260054e651bcf001bacee9b843b8ca9c8","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"accelerationIncludingGravity","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent","title":"DeviceMotionEvent"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/accelerationIncludingGravity","title":"accelerationIncludingGravity"}],"pageTitle":"DeviceMotionEvent: accelerationIncludingGravity property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"a82a3051a9fcb2eb62afb0ba7ff65f2b6b5d4096d024346b13d4bd5a73d6c557"}
