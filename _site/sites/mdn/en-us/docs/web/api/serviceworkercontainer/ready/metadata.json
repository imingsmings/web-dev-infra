It returns a Promise that\n  will never reject, and which waits indefinitely until\n  the ServiceWorkerRegistration associated with the current page has\n  an active worker. Once that\n  condition is met, it resolves with\n  the ServiceWorkerRegistration.","popularity":0.0022,"modified":"2023-04-08T06:00:31.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/serviceworkercontainer/ready","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/serviceworkercontainer/ready/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/f2f9346c0c0e9f6676f2df9f1850933e274401de","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"ready","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer","title":"ServiceWorkerContainer"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/ready","title":"ready"}],"pageTitle":"ServiceWorkerContainer: ready property - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"491b36b7a0e3668ff4e0dd584651278de8f31422e5bdc6f96f8757ad2d5dba54"}
