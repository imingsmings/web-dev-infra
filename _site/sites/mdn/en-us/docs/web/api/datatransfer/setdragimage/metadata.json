This image is created automatically, so you do not need to create it yourself.\n  However, if a custom image is desired, the\n  DataTransfer.setDragImage() method can be used to set the\n  custom image to be used. The image will typically be an <img> element\n  but it can also be a <canvas> or any other visible element.","popularity":0.0069,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/datatransfer/setdragimage","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/datatransfer/setdragimage/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"setDragImage()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer","title":"DataTransfer"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/setDragImage","title":"setDragImage()"}],"pageTitle":"DataTransfer: setDragImage() method - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"47429f7f516896fb5dc3ad3ddc20b2d30097fad0b8e04a935875edec852dbe18"}
