There's no magic object provided by either the WebGL or the WebXR API that represents the viewer that you can rotate and move around to automatically change what's seen on the screen. In this guide we show how use WebGL to simulate camera movements without having a camera to move. These techniques can be used in any WebGL (or WebXR) project.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/cameras","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/cameras/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Viewpoints and viewers: Simulating cameras in WebXR","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Cameras","title":"Viewpoints and viewers: Simulating cameras in WebXR"}],"pageTitle":"Viewpoints and viewers: Simulating cameras in WebXR - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5b51090a7a30082bfd1622be19fdd21ac6bca338cc320b8c14bb2c2068103d13"}
