However, in order to provide the ability to present scenes in true 3D using XR headsets and other such equipment, WebXR has additional concepts that must be understood.","popularity":0.0009,"modified":"2023-02-28T05:34:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/geometry","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/geometry/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/80d4cfb4515b339111e175dbeb8d2b91fd3ee1a0","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Geometry and reference spaces in WebXR","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Geometry","title":"Geometry and reference spaces in WebXR"}],"pageTitle":"Geometry and reference spaces in WebXR - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"b7aed688f9b90971df164e63b62450074cec65a143f31212c94e97f7e024857f"}
