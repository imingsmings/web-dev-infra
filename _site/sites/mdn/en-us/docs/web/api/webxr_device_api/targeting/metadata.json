Instead, most applications find a way to simplify the implementation of their hit testing algorithms.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-02-19T08:44:25.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/targeting","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/targeting/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4f0f7386262363103a3e9cf482bb348d8570b331","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Targeting and hit detection","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Targeting","title":"Targeting and hit detection"}],"pageTitle":"Targeting and hit detection - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"81b26bc0f6a06b5aab88416834dc68d7c7098d6d81718b3da630702a78b61f5a"}
