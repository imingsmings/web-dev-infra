This is largely true, but there are a few specific topics that need to be revisited and some minor additional guidelines considered in order to ensure that your app looks right and, more importantly, that your 3D world doesn't cause people to become ill from vertigo or other effects that can be caused when what's being seen doesn't match what the brain expects from reality.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-03-16T15:51:10.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/perspective","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/perspective/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/73b724ad82b94d2a4c314924218367cea2740e97","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"A perspective retrospective for WebXR developers","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Perspective","title":"A perspective retrospective for WebXR developers"}],"pageTitle":"A perspective retrospective for WebXR developers - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5546a108a86f9e97a166cf4aa258e2c4a3a5d13de3ad097f7a0b0674a0afdfa6"}
