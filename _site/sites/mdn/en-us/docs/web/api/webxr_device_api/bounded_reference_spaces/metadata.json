Not only is it represented by a unique subclass, XRBoundedReferenceSpace, but it's the only one which restricts movement based not upon virtual restrictions but upon limitations imposed by the real world. This article examines bounded reference spaces as represented by XRBoundedReferenceSpace, describing what they are and how they're used.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-12-04T19:52:38.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/bounded_reference_spaces","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/bounded_reference_spaces/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4a7f3948e907b117fa2ea190fc6795642c49d624","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using bounded reference spaces","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Bounded_reference_spaces","title":"Using bounded reference spaces"}],"pageTitle":"Using bounded reference spaces - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"b91a7f9b711e760455dbe849cd8a1171a47c63dcbedba8ed62801b46e834db39"}
