To accomplish this, software needs the ability to not only track the locations, orientation, and movements of objects in the virtual world, but the user's location, orientation, and movement as well. But WebXR goes beyond that by adding the ability to track the location, orientation, and motion of the input devices which generate data used to determine the position and movement of individual parts of the viewer's body (with appropriate equipment).","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/spatial_tracking","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/spatial_tracking/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Spaces and reference spaces: Spatial tracking in WebXR","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Spatial_tracking","title":"Spaces and reference spaces: Spatial tracking in WebXR"}],"pageTitle":"Spaces and reference spaces: Spatial tracking in WebXR - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"f1aecf223b33c55ac68c8be186ff4eff2933716535c0651987c193198fb53935"}
