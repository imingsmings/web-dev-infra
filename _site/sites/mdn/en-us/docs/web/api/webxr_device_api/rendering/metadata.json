This article covers the process of driving the frames of the XR scene to the device in the rendering loop, using the XRSession to obtain an XRFrame object representing each frame, which is then used to prepare the framebuffer for delivery to the XR device.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-07-25T00:27:48.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/rendering","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webxr_device_api/rendering/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/592f6ec42e54981b6573b58ec0343c9aa8cbbda8","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Rendering and the WebXR frame animation callback","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API","title":"WebXR Device API"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Rendering","title":"Rendering and the WebXR frame animation callback"}],"pageTitle":"Rendering and the WebXR frame animation callback - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0f2d203e5c075a4ca033321ac62c5869641abe573c05094142dcf2952b25b160"}
