You can think of it as a description of a specific eye or camera and how it views the world. A 3D frame will involve two views, one for each eye, separated by an appropriate distance which approximates the distance between the viewer's eyes. This allows the two views, when projected in isolation into the appropriate eyes, to simulate a 3D world.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/xrview","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/xrview/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"XRView","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRView","title":"XRView"}],"pageTitle":"XRView - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"64cf8b3f16b2ef4bb6fe251e7b1c9ec5db7200fe97f83599f1eb4da5c4566eec"}
