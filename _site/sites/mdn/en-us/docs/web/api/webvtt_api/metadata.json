The primary purpose of WebVTT files is to add text overlays to a <video>. WebVTT is a text based format, which must be encoded using UTF-8. Where you can use spaces you can also use tabs. There is also a small API available to represent and manage these tracks and the data needed to perform the playback of the text at the correct times.","popularity":0.0211,"modified":"2023-11-26T04:26:58.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/api/webvtt_api","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/webvtt_api/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/9bb88159cc0e6e964baa2d111a6d00524402ecdb","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API","title":"Web APIs"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API","title":"Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT)"}],"pageTitle":"Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT) - Web APIs | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0b527986796c99ebb1692fe6a4d89a972565a94078b8663c297da9b48c23c316"}
