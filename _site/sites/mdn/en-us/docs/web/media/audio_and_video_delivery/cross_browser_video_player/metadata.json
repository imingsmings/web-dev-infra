As well as working fullscreen, the player features custom controls rather than just using the browser defaults. The player controls themselves won't be styled beyond the basics required to get them working; full styling of the player will be taken care of in a future article.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-12-04T18:26:44.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/media/audio_and_video_delivery/cross_browser_video_player","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/media/audio_and_video_delivery/cross_browser_video_player/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/cfe622c944a58809c185aa71f6d5885f83cdfc3a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Creating a cross-browser video player","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media","title":"Web media technologies"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery","title":"Audio and Video Delivery"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/cross_browser_video_player","title":"Creating a cross-browser video player"}],"pageTitle":"Creating a cross-browser video player - Web media technologies | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"fc0b9b05bb78d4ca9c5f32de67a910be3b078343a454a82cf17a501ae636923e"}
