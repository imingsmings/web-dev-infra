The availability of choices is good for the user, in that they can choose the format that suits their needs best. There is a drawback, however: because there are so many to choose from, with so many different kinds of licenses and design principles involved, each web browser developer is left to its own devices when deciding which media file types and codecs to support.","popularity":0.0007,"modified":"2023-08-24T22:17:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/media/formats/support_issues","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/media/formats/support_issues/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/381c51574a3e6a07ee09c63493452440f046038d","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Handling media support issues in web content","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media","title":"Web media technologies"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats","title":"Media type and format guide: image, audio, and video content"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Support_issues","title":"Handling media support issues in web content"}],"pageTitle":"Handling media support issues in web content - Web media technologies | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"72678e43cbb9cd307fdce2ce2a2ed7018968fc059e19d0e684c2e2aec89e71b4"}
