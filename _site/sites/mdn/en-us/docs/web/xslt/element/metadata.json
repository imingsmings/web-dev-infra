A top-level element must appear as the child of either <xsl:stylesheet> or <xsl:transform>. An instruction, on the other hand, is associated with a template. A stylesheet may include several templates. A third type of element, not discussed here, is the literal result element (LRE). An LRE also appears in a template. It consists of any non-instruction element that should be copied as-is to the result document, for example, an <hr> element in an HTML conversion stylesheet.","popularity":0.0013,"modified":"2023-10-04T23:23:49.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/xslt/element","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/xslt/element/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e3faa375b0179de77a5eff00074e3d168a0a904c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"XSLT elements reference","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT","title":"XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element","title":"XSLT elements reference"}],"pageTitle":"XSLT elements reference - XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5217996a20aa93b28f6a3dac476b85a4b1088d9113aee3ced7e9b824e6583479"}
