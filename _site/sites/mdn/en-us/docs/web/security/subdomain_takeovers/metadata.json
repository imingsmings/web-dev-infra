Typically, this happens when the subdomain has a canonical name (CNAME) in the Domain Name System (DNS), but no host is providing content for it. This can happen because either a virtual host hasn't been published yet or a virtual host has been removed. An attacker can take over that subdomain by providing their own virtual host and then hosting their own content for it.","popularity":0.0067,"modified":"2023-12-04T12:04:17.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/security/subdomain_takeovers","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/security/subdomain_takeovers/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/8d766d1d1c60a2d6d2c95bd2aa9d0b297d9c70ac","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Subdomain takeovers","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security","title":"Security on the web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subdomain_takeovers","title":"Subdomain takeovers"}],"pageTitle":"Subdomain takeovers - Security on the web | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"78032b454ed4eff508df178de3f2769556b9682195912eb45a6acd292167afbc"}
