Traditionally, web developers have used cookies to store all kinds of data, for all kinds of purposes, and it has been easy for attackers to exploit this tendency. As a result, browsers have started to limit what you can do with cross-site cookies, with the aim of removing access to them altogether in the future.</p>\n<p>You should prepare for the removal of cross-site cookies by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on and/or by implementing desired information persistence in other ways.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Use an alternative client-side storage mechanism such as the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API\">Web Storage API</a> to persist data. Web storage does have the downside that the data is stored per-origin, so it can't be shared. Note that web storage has two variants — <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code>. We would recommend using <code>sessionStorage</code> for extra security, as data only persists for the lifetime of the window or tab it exists in. <code>localStorage</code> data persists even after the window or tab is closed and reopened.
