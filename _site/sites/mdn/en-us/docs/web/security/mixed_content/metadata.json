An HTTPS page that includes content fetched using cleartext HTTP is called a mixed content page. Pages like this are only partially encrypted, leaving the unencrypted content accessible to sniffers and man-in-the-middle attackers. That leaves the pages unsafe.","popularity":0.0396,"modified":"2023-07-04T10:01:14.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/security/mixed_content","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/security/mixed_content/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e74627e6fd9ba19696b918c2bdddfff8aa160787","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Mixed content","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security","title":"Security on the web"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content","title":"Mixed content"}],"pageTitle":"Mixed content - Security on the web | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1df382adfd5c7a77f70d761bb530e264ce847476959d1f5e42afd6ec41bf2497"}
