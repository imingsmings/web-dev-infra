Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â€” many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional programming since functions are first-class objects that can be easily created via expressions and passed around like any other object.","popularity":0.0633,"modified":"2023-11-15T05:37:52.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/language_overview","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/language_overview/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e822af5fc37c5cd436a58b05656cc82e18cf7d63","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"JavaScript language overview","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_overview","title":"JavaScript language overview"}],"pageTitle":"JavaScript language overview - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"02485811907835c392585e155a6bfa3444f91d8f712a42fedbb27bc247dae419"}
