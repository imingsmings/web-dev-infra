Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded, and zero bits are shifted in from the left. This operation is also called \"zero-filling right shift\", because the sign bit becomes 0, so the resulting number is always positive. Unsigned right shift does not accept BigInt values.","popularity":0.0129,"modified":"2023-09-07T01:22:04.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/unsigned_right_shift","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/unsigned_right_shift/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c6f0f106b9083984dbf597678def6561729bb459","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Unsigned right shift (>>>)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators","title":"Expressions and operators"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unsigned_right_shift","title":"Unsigned right shift (>>>)"}],"pageTitle":"Unsigned right shift (>>>) - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"b5fcd2c98632d6935bd3ab56dc5ca4858f85d655d156468f5cd036770789534f"}
