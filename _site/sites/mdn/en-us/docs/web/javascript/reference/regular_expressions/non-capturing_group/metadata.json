It acts like the grouping operator in JavaScript expressions, and unlike capturing groups, it does not memorize the matched text, allowing for better performance and avoiding confusion when the pattern also contains useful capturing groups.","popularity":0.0204,"modified":"2023-09-12T03:52:28.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/regular_expressions/non-capturing_group","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/regular_expressions/non-capturing_group/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4f86aad2b0b66c0d2041354ec81400c574ab56ca","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Non-capturing group: (?:...)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions","title":"Regular expressions"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Non-capturing_group","title":"Non-capturing group: (?:...)"}],"pageTitle":"Non-capturing group: (?:...) - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"50c1565ba0c752b6f62d4ada9857351871f3ee34a44f736672ba5210d3c6dd3b"}
