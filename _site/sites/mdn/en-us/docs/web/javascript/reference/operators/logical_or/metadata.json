It is typically used with\n  boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value. However,\n  the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified\n  operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a\n  non-Boolean value.","popularity":0.096,"modified":"2023-09-25T07:33:31.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/logical_or","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/logical_or/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/fb85334ffa4a2c88d209b1074909bee0e0abd57a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Logical OR (||)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators","title":"Expressions and operators"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR","title":"Logical OR (||)"}],"pageTitle":"Logical OR (||) - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"53e35a3a8f66604174e2c9b4b135dbe953d00a46a01d007cd01274bc34b617c3"}
