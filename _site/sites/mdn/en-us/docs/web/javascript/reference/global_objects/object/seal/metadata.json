Sealing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-configurable. A sealed object has a fixed set of properties: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability and configurability cannot be changed, and its prototype cannot be re-assigned. Values of existing properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. seal() returns the same object that was passed in.","popularity":0.02,"modified":"2023-02-21T01:57:14.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/object/seal","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/object/seal/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/fcd80ee4c8477b6f73553bfada841781cf74cf46","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Object.seal()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects","title":"Standard built-in objects"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object","title":"Object"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal","title":"Object.seal()"}],"pageTitle":"Object.seal() - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"2ccf720d25785226cd76729d1d4bb36adf6ec197b9bfc032730f2d65ef722280"}
