Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code. Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally.","popularity":0.0664,"modified":"2023-09-12T03:52:28.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/strict_mode","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/strict_mode/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4f86aad2b0b66c0d2041354ec81400c574ab56ca","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Strict mode","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode","title":"Strict mode"}],"pageTitle":"Strict mode - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"beadb9de4d3b26c69af272315eaffbfc02c4263480bc1f1b64a930974553f5a2"}
