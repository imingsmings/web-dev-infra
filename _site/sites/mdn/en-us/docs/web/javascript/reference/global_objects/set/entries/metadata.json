For Set objects there is no key like in Map objects. However, to keep the API similar to the Map object, each entry has the same value for its key and value here, so that an array [value, value] is returned.","popularity":0.0181,"modified":"2023-08-24T22:55:36.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/set/entries","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/set/entries/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/27180875516cc311342e74b596bfb589b7211e0c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Set.prototype.entries()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects","title":"Standard built-in objects"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set","title":"Set"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/entries","title":"Set.prototype.entries()"}],"pageTitle":"Set.prototype.entries() - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"cb06da6d2575dc6b8576ae3f1c982ded5b2d82e6acc3188aa3b0c5706abed72a"}
