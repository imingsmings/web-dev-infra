Freezing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable. A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties cannot be added, existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed, and the object's prototype cannot be re-assigned. freeze() returns the same object that was passed in.","popularity":0.0502,"modified":"2023-06-13T03:58:10.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/object/freeze","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/object/freeze/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/892e4301623f10505dc19e56ba9fb7b505530722","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Object.freeze()","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects","title":"Standard built-in objects"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object","title":"Object"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze","title":"Object.freeze()"}],"pageTitle":"Object.freeze() - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1d80d624ceb6134a134f41b79861492400506cec234756f26b66d1d19ca691d7"}
