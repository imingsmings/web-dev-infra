Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded, and copies of the leftmost bit are shifted in from the left. This operation is also called \"sign-propagating right shift\" or \"arithmetic right shift\", because the sign of the resulting number is the same as the sign of the first operand.","popularity":0.0181,"modified":"2023-08-18T10:32:05.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/right_shift","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/right_shift/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c6a18542128d1743b208c24de2333f61b601f1a9","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Right shift (>>)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators","title":"Expressions and operators"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Right_shift","title":"Right shift (>>)"}],"pageTitle":"Right shift (>>) - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"bb512151cefb9570b714e8df2790c1afcd7a3125ff31ac1a3862a2797559a58d"}
