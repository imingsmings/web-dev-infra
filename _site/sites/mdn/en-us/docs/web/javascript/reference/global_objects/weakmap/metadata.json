That is, an object's presence as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected. Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values in any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well — as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere. The only primitive type that can be used as a WeakMap key is symbol — more specifically, non-registered symbols — because non-registered symbols are guaranteed to be unique and cannot be re-created.","popularity":0.0313,"modified":"2023-11-08T04:45:53.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/weakmap","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/weakmap/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/41cddfdaeed4a73fb8234c332150df8e54df31e9","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"WeakMap","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference","title":"Reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects","title":"Standard built-in objects"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap","title":"WeakMap"}],"pageTitle":"WeakMap - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"425858dfc843ef7a17a0f13368b6ce1ea05337c690f9ae4f17f25b824a3a1888"}
