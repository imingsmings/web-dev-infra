In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they don't need to worry about memory management.","popularity":0.0444,"modified":"2023-09-12T03:52:28.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/javascript/memory_management","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/memory_management/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4f86aad2b0b66c0d2041354ec81400c574ab56ca","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Memory management","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_management","title":"Memory management"}],"pageTitle":"Memory management - JavaScript | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"28e38d44883e1b6affd9585704b1eb98eab7fe47b8c4749ef29e1b8778d2b8bb"}
