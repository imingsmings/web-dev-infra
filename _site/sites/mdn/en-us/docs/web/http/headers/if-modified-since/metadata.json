If\n  the resource has not been modified since, the response is a 304\n  without any body; the Last-Modified response header of a previous\n  request contains the date of last modification. Unlike\n  If-Unmodified-Since, If-Modified-Since can only be used\n  with a GET or HEAD.","popularity":0.0133,"modified":"2023-04-10T19:47:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/http/headers/if-modified-since","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/http/headers/if-modified-since/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/0880a90f3811475d78bc4b2c344eb4146f25f66c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"If-Modified-Since","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP","title":"HTTP"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers","title":"HTTP headers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since","title":"If-Modified-Since"}],"pageTitle":"If-Modified-Since - HTTP | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"86d72457348b18004eaa6850fe7fbdca6ea0c471088ee26b8412d87b5f9876ee"}
