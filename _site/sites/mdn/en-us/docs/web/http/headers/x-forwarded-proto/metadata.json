Your server access logs contain the protocol used between\n  the server and the load balancer, but not the protocol used between the client and the\n  load balancer. To determine the protocol used between the client and the load balancer,\n  the X-Forwarded-Proto request header can be used.","popularity":0.0158,"modified":"2023-04-10T19:47:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/http/headers/x-forwarded-proto","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/http/headers/x-forwarded-proto/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/0880a90f3811475d78bc4b2c344eb4146f25f66c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"X-Forwarded-Proto","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP","title":"HTTP"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers","title":"HTTP headers"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto","title":"X-Forwarded-Proto"}],"pageTitle":"X-Forwarded-Proto - HTTP | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"624b31ca128d39de08adb6630dd4f8cd61f3345ed167452db597170a689e9ca5"}
