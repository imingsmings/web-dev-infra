In that case, the request, usually an upload or a modification of a resource,\n  cannot be made and this error response is sent back.","popularity":0.0289,"modified":"2023-04-10T19:47:15.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/http/status/412","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/http/status/412/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/0880a90f3811475d78bc4b2c344eb4146f25f66c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"412 Precondition Failed","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP","title":"HTTP"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status","title":"HTTP response status codes"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/412","title":"412 Precondition Failed"}],"pageTitle":"412 Precondition Failed - HTTP | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"2ffc484dec8c1bd60e9c7459d50e8475c547b351398454e93d7eaba29d47f38c"}
