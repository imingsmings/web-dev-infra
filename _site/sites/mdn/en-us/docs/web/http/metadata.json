It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.","popularity":0.105,"modified":"2023-10-25T17:27:32.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/http","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/http/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/835d6632d59993861a0458510402787f8a2c3cb3","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"HTTP","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP","title":"HTTP"}],"pageTitle":"HTTP | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"41aacf4590d836cb2145b36a8e0516f542728ca279d3a153f40e5b82b4af4c7c"}
