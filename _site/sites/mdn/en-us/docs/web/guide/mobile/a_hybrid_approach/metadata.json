Web applications that want to heavily modify the content or user flow for mobile users should probably go for a separate mobile site. Content-oriented pages that don't need to modify their content for mobile users will be satisfied with responsive design. If you need to slightly alter the site's message for mobile users, but want to reap the benefits of a responsive design, a hybrid approach may be your best bet. Decisions like these are at the heart of mobile web development: be specific about what you would like to accomplish, and pick a practical approach while being aware of the tradeoffs.
