Just like for HTML or SVG, this text can become very verbose for complex content and so requires proper authoring tools such as converters from a lightweight markup language or WYSIWYG equation editors. Many such tools are available and it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list. Instead, this article focuses on common approaches and examples.","popularity":0.0034,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/mathml/authoring","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/mathml/authoring/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Authoring MathML","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/MathML","title":"MathML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Authoring","title":"Authoring MathML"}],"pageTitle":"Authoring MathML - MathML | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"d9d6e80801d7521eff67102b5346b8f03d259a6502978d10d850157269fb319e"}
