The browser UI provides a visible frame around the website, including UI features like back/forward buttons and a title for the page. The Web APIs your website calls are implemented by the browser engine.</p>\n<p>PWAs typically look like platform-specific apps － they are usually displayed without the browser UI around them － but they are, as a matter of technology, still websites. This means they need a browser engine, like the ones in Chrome or Firefox, to manage and run them. With a platform-specific app, the platform OS manages the app, providing the environment in which it runs. With a PWA, a browser engine performs this background role, just like it does for normal websites.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app/pwa-environment.svg\" alt=\"Diagram comparing the runtime environment for traditional websites, PWAs, and platform-specific apps\" width=\"561\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>In our documentation for PWAs, we sometimes refer to the browser playing this background role. We might say, for example, \"The browser starts a PWA's service worker when a push notification is received.\" Here, the browser's activity is entirely in the background. From the PWA's point of view, it might as well be the operating system that started it.

This is because service workers can be started by the browser in the background when they are needed (for example, to handle a push notification).</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"pwas_and_single-page_apps","title":"PWAs and single-page apps","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Traditionally a website is built as a collection of interlinked pages. When the user clicks a link from one page in the site to another page in the same site, the browser loads the new page as a completely new entity, including the HTML and the subresources that the HTML loads, like CSS and JavaScript. In a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA\">single-page app</a>, the site consists of a single HTML page, and when the user clicks internal links, this is handled by JavaScript fetching new content from the server and updating the relevant parts of the page.</p>\n<p>Single-page apps can provide a user experience that is closer to platform-specific apps, so PWAs are often implemented as single-page apps. In particular, single-page apps make it easier to achieve a seamless user interface, in which the user is presented with a single, consistent page, and only the relevant parts of the page are updated as the user interacts with the app.</p>\n<p>However, PWAs don't have to be single-page apps, and single-page apps don't have to be PWAs.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"progressive_enhancement","title":"Progressive enhancement","isH3":true,"content":"<p>While <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement\">progressive enhancement</a> is a desirable attribute for most websites, it is especially important for PWAs, which expect to run on a wide range of devices and often use advanced Web APIs which may not be supported by all browsers.</p>\n<p>One basic component of progressive enhancement is that, if the user visits your PWA on the web by entering its URL in a browser, the user can interact with the app like a normal website. But if the browser can install it, the user will be prompted to install it and the app will appear as a new feature on their device.</p>\n<p>PWAs should perform feature detection for advanced APIs and provide acceptable fallback experiences.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API\">Background Sync API</a> enables a PWA to ask a service worker to make a network request as soon as the device has connectivity. A classic use case for this is messaging. Suppose the user composes a message, but when the user tries to send the message, the device is offline. The Background Sync API enables the device to send the message in the background once the device is connected. On a device that does not support Background Sync, the app should let the user know the message could not be sent, giving them the chance to try again later.</p>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Platform-specific apps","id":"platform-specific_apps"},{"text":"Traditional websites","id":"traditional_websites"},{"text":"Progressive web apps","id":"progressive_web_apps"}],"summary":"A progressive web app (PWA) is an app that's built using web platform technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.","popularity":0.0119,"modified":"2023-07-04T10:01:14.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/progressive_web_apps/guides/what_is_a_progressive_web_app","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/progressive_web_apps/guides/what_is_a_progressive_web_app/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e74627e6fd9ba19696b918c2bdddfff8aa160787","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"What is a progressive web app?","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps","title":"Progressive web apps"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app","title":"What is a progressive web app?"}],"pageTitle":"What is a progressive web app? - Progressive web apps | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
