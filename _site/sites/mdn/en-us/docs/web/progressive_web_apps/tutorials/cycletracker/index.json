Like any regular website, CycleTracker is hosted on and downloadable from a web server. All we need is a text editor: CycleTracker, like all PWAs, doesn't require any additional programming language knowledge, packaging, or proprietary SDK. CycleTracker, like any PWA, can be seamlessly installed on any operating system without the need of app stores (nor app store approval and fees).</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt id=\"use_standard_and_open_web_technologies\"><a href=\"#use_standard_and_open_web_technologies\">Use standard and open web technologies</a></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Historically, for an application to be installable on an OS, such as Windows, iOS, MacOS, Linux, and Android, the applications are developed in OS-supported programming languages, like C#, .Net, Objective C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, or Python. PWAs are based on a different model: they use a single code base, written using standard open web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that work across OSes.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"no_compiling_required\"><a href=\"#no_compiling_required\">No compiling required</a></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>With most programming languages—like Java, C/C++, and Kotlin, which are commonly used for building Android apps, and Objective-C and Swift, for iOS—the code needs to be compiled and packaged into an installable format, like .exe, .dmg, .elf, and .apk, or another installable file type, depending on the operating system. Depending on the language, compiling and packaging may require the OS's <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDK\">SDK</a>. PWAs use web technologies supported by every operating system that doesn't need to be packaged or compiled. Yes, developer teams can have complex build systems, but, as we will demonstrate as we build CycleTracker, PWAs can be built out of just HTML and JavaScript (and CSS, though styling is not necessarily required for a PWA).</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"available_anywhere_and_everywhere\"><a href=\"#available_anywhere_and_everywhere\">Available anywhere and everywhere</a></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Single-OS-only applications are distributed to users through downloads, often in proprietary app stores.

PWAs don't have these requirements. If you want to distribute your CycleTracker app, you won't require an intermediary. A user can access your app by visiting its online version. But if you want, it is possible to distribute your PWA on the Play Store and App Store, undifferentiated from other iOS or Android apps.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"easy_for_the_user_to_install\"><a href=\"#easy_for_the_user_to_install\">Easy for the user to install</a></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>Historically, downloaded single-OS-only applications have to be intentionally installed by the user.

If a user makes changes while offline, service workers enable PWAs to sync data once connectivity is restored. With service workers, the user doesn't need to be actively engaging with the PWA, in fact, the PWA doesn't even need to be open, for it to send and retrieve server data.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"cycletracker_pwa_lessons","title":"CycleTracker PWA lessons","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The base web application for this PWA tutorial is a period tracker, in which the user can track the beginning and end of each menstrual cycle.
