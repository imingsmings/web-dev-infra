Currently it can only contain a single value, client_mode, which specifies the context in which the app should be loaded when launched. For example, in an existing web app client containing an instance of the app, or in a new web app client. This leaves scope for more launch_handler values to be defined in the future.","popularity":0.0038,"modified":"2023-09-05T07:08:49.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/manifest/launch_handler","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/manifest/launch_handler/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/880e0d7edf6b7effe44b08c4ff0f697a3e5a929a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"launch_handler","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest","title":"Web app manifests"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/launch_handler","title":"launch_handler"}],"pageTitle":"launch_handler - Web app manifests | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"010d6bed409c6a8c5037e5d5b4c92fdfe7acf5a0ff0d630f12deb6fa75f5c5b0"}
