Sliders, menu bars, file list views, and more can be built with a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Since the HTML4 specification doesn't provide built-in tags that semantically describe these kinds of widgets, developers typically resort to using generic elements such as <div> and <span>. While this results in a widget that looks like its desktop counterpart, there usually isn't enough semantic information in the markup to be usable by an assistive technology.","popularity":0.0097,"modified":"2023-11-14T12:08:11.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/accessibility/an_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/accessibility/an_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acad5b9afc0a9e20144d49fd3fbb7f4fa92c9192","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"An overview of accessible web applications and widgets","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility","title":"Accessibility"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets","title":"An overview of accessible web applications and widgets"}],"pageTitle":"An overview of accessible web applications and widgets - Accessibility | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"7dbf5ba712b0d9e7c56f50ea3c5f5978d955afcc645956a40faadac85a4c079c"}
