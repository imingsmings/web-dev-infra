Authors must assign an ARIA role and the appropriate states and properties to an element during its life-cycle, unless the element already has appropriate ARIA semantics (via use of an appropriate HTML element). Addition of ARIA semantics only exposes extra information to a browser's accessibility API, and does not affect a page's DOM.","popularity":0.0273,"modified":"2023-07-17T23:05:13.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/accessibility/aria/aria_techniques","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/accessibility/aria/aria_techniques/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/07f0cf4375aaa02e1071d8bd0e8518db7609b7a9","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Using ARIA: Roles, states, and properties","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility","title":"Accessibility"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA","title":"ARIA"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques","title":"Using ARIA: Roles, states, and properties"}],"pageTitle":"Using ARIA: Roles, states, and properties - Accessibility | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"929d9ae87eae70b8bf73b3920cf76bf7add5aab14660654b3564e12bb1536ca2"}
