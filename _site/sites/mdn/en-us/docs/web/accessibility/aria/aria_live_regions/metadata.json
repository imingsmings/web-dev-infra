While these changes are usually visually apparent to users who can see the page, they may not be obvious to users of assistive technologies. ARIA live regions fill this gap and provide a way to programmatically expose dynamic content changes in a way that can be announced by assistive technologies.","popularity":0.032,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/accessibility/aria/aria_live_regions","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/accessibility/aria/aria_live_regions/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"ARIA live regions","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility","title":"Accessibility"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA","title":"ARIA"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions","title":"ARIA live regions"}],"pageTitle":"ARIA live regions - Accessibility | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0f63ad6b9f6fb0d75d697b57243197d44d5010942f7d0d68c40a575b7448fa1d"}
