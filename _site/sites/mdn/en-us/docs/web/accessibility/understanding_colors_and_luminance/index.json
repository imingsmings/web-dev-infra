The values are in the order of red, green, and blue. We can also set the sRGB values directly by a number from 0 to 255.</p>\n<p>Shown after that are hex color values. Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base-16, where the 0-255 integer is represented by two digits ranging from 0-15 using the digits 0-9 and a-f for 10-15. Thus, <code>ff</code> = <code>255</code>, <code>00</code> = <code>0</code>, and <code>d5</code> = <code>200</code>. The '#' symbol precedes the color to indicate the value is hex.</p>\n<p>If all values are pairs of identical digits, the value can be represented by single digits that the browser will duplicate. Thus <code>f00</code> is the same as <code>ff0000</code>. If a fourth set of numbers is present, that value is the A in RGBA, the alpha channel defining transparency in terms of the opacity value of the color. A higher value means the color is more opaque and therefore, less transparent. In the examples above, the alpha value is <code>f</code>, <code>ff</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>100%</code> for fully opaque.</p>\n<p>The examples also show the legacy <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb#legacy_syntax_rgba\"><code>rgba()</code></a> syntax. The older syntax for color functions was comma-separated, with separate functions for when the alpha channel was included. New color functions only have one syntax with space-separated (rather than comma-separated) values, with the alpha channel, if present, being preceded by a slash.</p>\n<p>The following examples show \"HSL\", which stands for <em>Hue, Saturation, and Lightness</em>. HSL color values are considered by many to be more intuitive than RGB values. The color produced from the settings are still in the sRGB colorspace, but <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl\"><code>hsl()</code></a> is an intuitive syntax for many. The hue is adjusted as an angle, and it is easy to create a user interface using a knob or circular control to adjust the hue. Do note that HSL colors incorporate <em>lightness</em>, not <em>luminance</em>, which is a significant consideration.</p>\n<p>The last examples shows \"HWB\" which stands for <em>Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness</em>. Unlike <code>rgba()</code> and <code>hsla()</code>, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb\"><code>hwb()</code></a> does not have a legacy <code>a</code> syntax and does not support comma-separated values. With both <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hwb()</code> the first value can be a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number\"><code>&lt;number&gt;</code></a> or an <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle\"><code>&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> value.

White has 100% relative luminance, black has 0% relative luminance (in most but not all literature). Interpreting for the W3C standard above, that would mean that white, normalized to 1, would have an RGB value of <code>rgb(255 255 255)</code> and black, normalized to 0, would have an RGB value of <code>rgb(0 0 0)</code>.

This is important, as luminance contrast enables the development of content that even those with color blindness can see. With this understanding, luminance may be manipulated so that colors that are difficult to see because of their low luminance could be made more legible by placing these colors against another with contrasting luminance. An interesting study by NASA on the color blue, for example, noted that this color, which has low luminance, can be made legible if <em>care was taken to achieve adequate luminance contrast</em> (From the article, <a href=\"https://colorusage.arc.nasa.gov/blue_2.php\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Designing with blue</a>)</p>\n<p>Calculations for relative luminance are not casual ones.

Colors appear differently depending on what is surrounding them. In the following image, both the yellow dots and the grey squares are the same sRGB color. Context-sensitive color perception makes them appear different; your brain's image processing adjusts the perception based on what it thinks is in shadow or not.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_Colors_and_Luminance/yellowdotcheckershadow_dlyon.png\" alt=\"An image of a checkerboard, where identical colors look different if they are in shadow\" width=\"344\" height=\"269\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>The yellow dots in this image are identical colors on your monitor, but they appear different due to context. (Image D.Lyon)</p>\n<p>Our contrast, lightness, and color perception are affected by the context of the nearby colors and other features of a design or image. This makes predicting contrast challenging. It is not as simple as a mathematical ratio between two colors.</p>\n<p>To summarize, color is as much about human physiology and perception in the brain as it is about measuring light from a computer screen. It's also important to understand that the ambient light environment affects the ability to perceive color and contrast. Light and its measurements are linear, but human vision and perception are not.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"adaptation","title":"Adaptation","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Our eyes don't adapt equally, in the same way, going from light areas to dark ones and vice versa.

At least two kinds of adaptation take place: local adaptation and adaptation to an ambient environment.</p>\n<p>Local adaptation occurs right on the \"page\" a reader is looking at. For example, if you have blue text within a gray \"highlighted\" area, your eyes will perceive that exact blue text with a gray highlight differently if it is in a black <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div\"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>, or a white one.

Generally speaking, most focus is on luminance when attempting to ensure enough contrast between text and its background or evaluating the possibility of inducing seizures in those sensitive to photosensitive seizures. One aspect of color (\"hues\"), independent of luminance, deserves special attention as it applies to accessibility: the concept of saturation. This is due to its ability to cause seizures in those susceptible to photosensitive seizures, regardless of color's luminance. As discussed in <a href=\"#the-special-case-of-red\">the particular case of red</a>,\n  the <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.532.7063&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Epilepsy Foundation</a> noted that, <em>irrespective of luminance, a transition to or from a saturated red is also considered a risk</em>.\n</p>\n<p>Saturation is sometimes described as the \"purity\" or \"intensity\" of a color. Although these are good definitions for \"pigments\" in an artist's paint set, they are not as accurate as color definitions from a computer screen.</p>\n<p>When it comes to color on a monitor, saturated colors are of a particular wavelength. While the definition of saturation for each color space may differ, saturation is readily measured. The key is to know which color space you are working in and be ready to convert it if necessary.</p>\n<p>The color spaces most frequently considered when discussing photosensitivity are the RGB, HSL, and HSV, also known as HSB, color spaces. The HSV color space, which stands for <em>hue</em>, <em>saturation</em>, and <em>value</em>, and the synonym HSB, which stands for <em>hue</em>, <em>saturation</em>, and <em>brightness</em>), are represented in CSS as <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb\"><code>hwb()</code></a> for <em>hue</em>, <em>whiteness</em>, and <em>blackness</em>.</p>\n<p>It's important to know what color space you're working with. For example, saturated colors have a lightness of <code>0.5</code> in HSL, while in HWB, they have a value <code>1</code>. Saturation in the RGB color space is usually indicated by an RGB value of <code>255</code> or <code>100%</code> for the color in question. For example, a saturated red of hex value <code>#ff0000</code> has an RGB value of <code>rgb(255 0 0)</code> and an HSL value of <code>hsl(0 100% 50%)</code>. A different saturated red with a hex value of <code>#ff3300</code> has an RGB value of <code>rgb(255 51 0)</code> and an HSL value of <code>hsl(12 100% 50%)</code>. Both are \"saturated\" reds. They are two different \"hues\" but are both considered to be a saturated color.</p>\n<p>Saturation is not brightness. Brightness refers to how much white or black is mixed in with a color. One can decrease saturation by adding white, black, or gray to the color; to take the example further, brightness can be increased by adding white, reducing saturation. A typical example is to add white to red to get the color pink. Pink is considered a desaturated red.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"saturation_and_luminance","title":"Saturation and luminance","isH3":true,"content":"<p>There is a loss of saturation at the extremes of luminance and the extremes of black and white.

It has been theorized that this is because the \"red\" sensitive cones of our eyes, which tend to cluster around the fovea (near the center), are physically located at a different location than the \"blue\" sensitive cones of our eyes, which are located away from the fovea and towards the rims.
