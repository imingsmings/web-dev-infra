The purpose of these shapes is fairly obvious from their names. Some of the parameters that determine their position and size are given, but an element reference would probably contain more accurate and complete descriptions along with other properties that won't be covered in here. However, since they're used in most SVG documents, it's necessary to give them some sort of introduction.","popularity":0.0263,"modified":"2023-03-06T23:38:10.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/svg/tutorial/basic_shapes","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/svg/tutorial/basic_shapes/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/b4f998244660723175f8e06b5d77f68cfb1d1f1a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Basic shapes","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG","title":"SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial","title":"SVG Tutorial"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes","title":"Basic shapes"}],"pageTitle":"Basic shapes - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"7b5c24d5756545fc4e42474a92cda65cbf5fc6c560327fe8ad94b20bacb8e08d"}
