It determines whether or not all of the named features are supported by the browser; if all of them are supported, the attribute evaluates to true end the element is rendered; otherwise, the attribute evaluates to false and the current element and its children are skipped and thus will not be rendered. This provides a way to design SVG that gracefully falls back when features aren't available.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-05-21T00:26:03.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/svg/attribute/requiredfeatures","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/svg/attribute/requiredfeatures/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/5f7c22deaa74973658257aeaa012ac2ec0be87ae","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"requiredFeatures","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG","title":"SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute","title":"SVG Attribute reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/requiredFeatures","title":"requiredFeatures"}],"pageTitle":"requiredFeatures - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5faabd23f09f3b699088b6c63b70af8e805905b78718158c357bf7d921555ff7"}
