Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared. Most importantly, since the fundamental format of XML is standardized, if you share or transmit XML across systems or platforms, either locally or over the internet, the recipient can still parse the data due to the standardized XML syntax.","popularity":0.0185,"modified":"2023-07-10T09:47:59.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/xml/xml_introduction","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/xml/xml_introduction/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/b6f343538eac4a803943b4e99b0c0545b372645a","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"XML introduction","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XML","title":"XML: Extensible Markup Language"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction","title":"XML introduction"}],"pageTitle":"XML introduction - XML: Extensible Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"4d8c4fb3eedb38b64c59e6427e7311e958f03a2c1dc75fdaf59c67ed7e8a91c6"}
