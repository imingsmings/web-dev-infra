This ensures they are available earlier and are less likely to block the page's render, improving performance. Even though the name contains the term load, it doesn't load and execute the script but only schedules it to be downloaded and cached with a higher priority.","popularity":0.0484,"modified":"2023-11-29T09:09:55.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/attributes/rel/preload","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/attributes/rel/preload/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/10b342385644e822d123694ad3bc8c2ca9abb2dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"rel=preload","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes","title":"HTML attribute reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel","title":"HTML attribute: rel"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload","title":"rel=preload"}],"pageTitle":"rel=preload - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"16e555ae890bd0e821c904fac788a8df905c313e9b9cb017f4343f3e8dd9cc1b"}
