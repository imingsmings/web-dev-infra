If the value of the element is greater than this, the element fails validation. This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the min attribute. If the max attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no max value is applied. If the max attribute is valid and a non-empty value is greater than the maximum allowed by the max attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission.","popularity":0.0059,"modified":"2023-04-17T00:05:31.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/attributes/max","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/attributes/max/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/940cd0b4ec3a07a5d5895459145cee15065fbb2c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"HTML attribute: max","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes","title":"HTML attribute reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max","title":"HTML attribute: max"}],"pageTitle":"HTML attribute: max - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"ab512740b2f03825b2df1c690533bf5201db1e774a32e7e0d8c1ab642b1ee22d"}
