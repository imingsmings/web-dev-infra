While marking up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for forms: it added new semantic types for the <input> element and constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.","popularity":0.0271,"modified":"2023-06-13T08:10:47.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/constraint_validation","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/constraint_validation/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e04d8d2766c468f149445c0bf438d09f9b2d188c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Constraint validation","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation","title":"Constraint validation"}],"pageTitle":"Constraint validation - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"e61a3818d8d3520b964aa253f6c4629a3a7c28967cd925ef23e765dd3bd68c7f"}
