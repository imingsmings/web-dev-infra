This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.","popularity":0.0475,"modified":"2023-11-29T23:52:08.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/content_categories","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/content_categories/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/3593033ad04260f717f220d25f7d379e427cf82b","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Content categories","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories","title":"Content categories"}],"pageTitle":"Content categories - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"560be7325367ca43a945782c5f978536946550877f5282e7bf6c97f44b37340c"}
