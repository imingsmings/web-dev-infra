It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.","popularity":0.0723,"modified":"2023-05-10T06:21:18.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/element/span","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/element/span/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/a46d4d15ea85b4bbb83df145228bc40f658868be","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"<span>","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element","title":"Elements"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span","title":"<span>"}],"pageTitle":"<span>: The Content Span element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"cff50140e97cd276290c8ebf7c1d16284e608d3c2ff38f77c0ece525cef90a71"}
