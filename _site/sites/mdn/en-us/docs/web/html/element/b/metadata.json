This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element.","popularity":0.0299,"modified":"2023-10-14T00:23:21.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/web/html/element/b","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/element/b/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e31cb5978e9f3c731c49db9ed0a15795b870e141","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"<b>","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web","title":"References"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element","title":"Elements"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b","title":"<b>"}],"pageTitle":"<b>: The Bring Attention To element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"eb80ad5c9d1565b60e7379cfd4dbb9b2a5388a3f6750bc6e1cfc945887edf358"}
