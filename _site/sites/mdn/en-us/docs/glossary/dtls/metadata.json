It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security (TLS), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.","popularity":0.0018,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/dtls","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/dtls/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/DTLS","title":"DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)"}],"pageTitle":"DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"72b487c8f3fd643ec91b1afee57220a481d429f85b1d8478e45506cafa77e79a"}
