They can do this quickly and efficiently because they operate at the bit level. Related flags in the same group are generally given complementary values representing different bit positions in a single value (e.g. hexadecimal), so that multiple flag settings can be represented by a single value.","popularity":0.0014,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/bitwise_flags","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/bitwise_flags/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Bitwise flags","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bitwise_flags","title":"Bitwise flags"}],"pageTitle":"Bitwise flags - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1c1525fda3f67020c2e924ca8d97cb75d43d1a22c228cf374a13efd1b278ea4e"}
