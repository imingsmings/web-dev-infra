For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body. Headers are case-insensitive, begin at the start of a line and are immediately followed by a ':' and a header-dependent value. The value finishes at the next CRLF or at the end of the message.","popularity":0.011,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/http_header","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/http_header/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"HTTP header","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_header","title":"HTTP header"}],"pageTitle":"HTTP header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1de21aaeaec3cbfb2a3ce945efc5e261698014625dc1ac388fdd24bef56669fd"}
