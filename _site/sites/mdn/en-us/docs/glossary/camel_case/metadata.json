The name comes from the similarity of the capital letters to the humps of a camel's back. It's often stylized as \"camelCase\" to remind the reader of its appearance.","popularity":0.0045,"modified":"2023-09-08T01:05:56.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/camel_case","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/camel_case/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/6aa664dc5ccb5edf0897f99ad5feb59325dff831","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Camel case","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Camel_case","title":"Camel case"}],"pageTitle":"Camel case - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"3fa8c4a3b97eb289268f2325145df5c3df2d0f5de7e4c9625d9b7c47e39ad84d"}
