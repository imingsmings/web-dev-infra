It is designed to be easily understood by humans and for this reason they must be translated by another software. Unlike low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, or may automate (or even entirely hide) significant areas of computing systems, making the process of developing simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is.","popularity":0.0015,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/high-level_programming_language","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/high-level_programming_language/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"High-level programming language","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/High-level_programming_language","title":"High-level programming language"}],"pageTitle":"High-level programming language - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"9b8674c4260adf4579ec35db0898c2954f5f41d4385c4eca07a30c94889d609b"}
