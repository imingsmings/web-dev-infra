Both TLS and SSL are client / server protocols that ensure communication privacy by using cryptographic protocols to provide security over a network. When a server and client communicate using TLS, it ensures that no third party can eavesdrop or tamper with any message.","popularity":0.0063,"modified":"2023-09-27T17:37:07.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/tls","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/tls/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/83f30ecaaeb6227dc0d4551f71eb8be1cacb8e94","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS","title":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)"}],"pageTitle":"Transport Layer Security (TLS) - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"230d25c71054d44f37e20be0773e8a7840637f767413846f215d8f3f31241aef"}
