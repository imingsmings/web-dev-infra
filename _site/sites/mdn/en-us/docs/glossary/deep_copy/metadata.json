As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you can be assured you're not causing the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a shallow copy, in which changes to nested properties in the source or the copy may cause the other object to change too.","popularity":0.0447,"modified":"2023-08-12T02:08:39.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/deep_copy","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/deep_copy/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/1c285cab12ee953a74d38a0800951126b48e1a81","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Deep copy","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy","title":"Deep copy"}],"pageTitle":"Deep copy - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"fb747fe8ebf98b4eeab0af547269c2bbb382993d898d37bcba8ddabe0a4fa038"}
