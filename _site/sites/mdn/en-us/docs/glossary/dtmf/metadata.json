Frequently referred to in the United States as \"touch tone\" (after the Touch-Tone trademark used when the transition from pulse dialing to DTMF began), DTMF makes it possible to signal the digits 0-9 as well as the letters \"A\" through \"D\" and the symbols \"#\" and \"*\". Few telephone keypads include the letters, which are typically used for control signaling by the telephone network.","popularity":0.0006,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/dtmf","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/dtmf/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/DTMF","title":"DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling)"}],"pageTitle":"DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling) - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"a1cf05b90468a0f0429c82021ff8d467d8249011cac8aff643efdad311430b92"}
