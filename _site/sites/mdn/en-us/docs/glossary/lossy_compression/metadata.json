In simpler terms: lossy compression causes data from the initial file to be lost, possibly causing degradation in quality. The process of such compression is irreversible; once lossy compression of the content has been performed, the content cannot be restored to its original state. Therefore, content that has undergone lossy compression should generally not be further edited.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/lossy_compression","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/lossy_compression/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Lossy compression","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Lossy_compression","title":"Lossy compression"}],"pageTitle":"Lossy compression - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"043ae627f3f334e83a1fe7a65a40088b68ca6d346ee5871eccbf386c18713684"}
