SIMD allows one same operation to be performed on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus performance gains â€” for example, for 3D graphics and video processing, physics simulations or cryptography, and other domains.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/simd","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/simd/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"SIMD","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/SIMD","title":"SIMD"}],"pageTitle":"SIMD - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"27958ad4aad6a88fe816b7528d3e4547e5c678f3b2c2497d8853a28129416d3d"}
