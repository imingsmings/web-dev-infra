Cryptanalysis creates techniques to break ciphers, in particular by methods more efficient than a brute-force search. In addition to traditional methods like frequency analysis and index of coincidence, cryptanalysis includes more recent methods, like linear cryptanalysis or differential cryptanalysis, that can break more advanced ciphers.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/cryptanalysis","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/cryptanalysis/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Cryptanalysis","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cryptanalysis","title":"Cryptanalysis"}],"pageTitle":"Cryptanalysis - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"0b355c3c31c1359b1fd2ca6d80804b94c026fbb67bb84afade54289f26782993"}
