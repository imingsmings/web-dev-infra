It does this without initially knowing what those capabilities are and without creating congestion. TCP slow start is an algorithm used to detect the available bandwidth for packet transmission, and balances the speed of a network connection. It prevents the appearance of network congestion whose capabilities are initially unknown, and slowly increases the volume of information diffused until the network's maximum capacity is found.","popularity":0.0019,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/tcp_slow_start","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/tcp_slow_start/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"TCP slow start","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_slow_start","title":"TCP slow start"}],"pageTitle":"TCP slow start - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"1cf67d10437754efe8b26451bb95a0888b9d417a3dfb5532a1ae02448ff78fae"}
