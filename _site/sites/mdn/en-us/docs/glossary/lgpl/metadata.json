The LGPL provides a more permissive alternative for the strictly copyleft GPL. While any derivative work using a GPL-licensed program must be released under the same terms (free to use, share, study, and modify), the LGPL only requires the LGPL-licensed component of the derivative program to continue using the LGPL, not the whole program. LGPL is usually used to license shared components such as libraries (.dll, .so, .jar, etc.).","popularity":0.0008,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/lgpl","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/lgpl/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"LGPL","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/LGPL","title":"LGPL"}],"pageTitle":"LGPL - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"d5b9716e8c8b0de48569465027d2763fd0269ea44e0c62d2c56226410bf98b6e"}
