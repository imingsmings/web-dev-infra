In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS. All safe methods are also idempotent, but not all idempotent methods are safe. For example, PUT and DELETE are both idempotent but unsafe.","popularity":0.0079,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/safe/http","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/safe/http/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Safe (HTTP Methods)","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe","title":"Safe"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP","title":"Safe (HTTP Methods)"}],"pageTitle":"Safe (HTTP Methods) - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"115763192c19bc6d10cf9bc26b3fdace76c68ea4003ae3a8bd55b0b85bc6becb"}
