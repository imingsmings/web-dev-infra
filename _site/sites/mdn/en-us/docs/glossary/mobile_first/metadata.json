The rationale behind the mobile-first approach is to provide users with good user experiences at all screen sizesâ€”by starting with creating a user experience that works well on small screens, and then building on top of that to further enrich the user experience as the screen size increases. The mobile-first approach contrasts with the older approach of designing for desktop screen sizes first, and then only later adding some support for small screen sizes.","popularity":0.001,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/mobile_first","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/mobile_first/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Mobile First","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mobile_First","title":"Mobile First"}],"pageTitle":"Mobile First - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"231f3efa9e5b80c761aeaa8f5dfafb107a766d2f999f2951af01785cd91216dd"}
