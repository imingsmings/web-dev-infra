This can be used for example to work out what should go on each page of a website. The name comes from the fact that often card sorting is carried out by literally writing the items to sort onto cards, and then arranging the cards into piles.","popularity":0.0009,"modified":"2023-06-08T13:19:16.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/card_sorting","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/card_sorting/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/ada5fa5ef15eadd44b549ecf906423b4a2092f34","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Card sorting","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Card_sorting","title":"Card sorting"}],"pageTitle":"Card sorting - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"2fa1e1b1cac03bc5549efe26a557255f87e50f2ae0d59066ff05406c54ff456f"}
