As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a deep copy, in which the source and copy are completely independent.","popularity":0.0381,"modified":"2023-08-12T02:08:39.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/glossary/shallow_copy","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/glossary/shallow_copy/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/1c285cab12ee953a74d38a0800951126b48e1a81","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Shallow copy","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary","title":"MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy","title":"Shallow copy"}],"pageTitle":"Shallow copy - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"345fe486f33519535c0c84f78918e85ff734230409685faea3593e095b6a1777"}
