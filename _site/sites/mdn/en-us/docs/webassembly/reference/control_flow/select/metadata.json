It shares some similarities with the ternary operator in other languages (e.g. false ? 10 : 20), but doesn't short-circuit. The instruction may be followed by an immediate value type: select (result T). select (result T) uses a different binary opcode, and allows types besides those introduced by the WebAssembly MVP (i32, i64, f32, f64), for example, it allows selection between two externref values.","popularity":0.001,"modified":"2023-11-03T06:30:13.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/webassembly/reference/control_flow/select","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/webassembly/reference/control_flow/select/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c681ed89305afd56d54ba6671673680bea041670","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Select","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/WebAssembly","title":"WebAssembly"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference","title":"WebAssembly instruction reference"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Control_flow","title":"WebAssembly control flow instructions"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Control_flow/Select","title":"Select"}],"pageTitle":"Select - WebAssembly | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"858153021725935cd501aa190d8283ed2d9ad1002f11772977d925acf5f2a872"}
