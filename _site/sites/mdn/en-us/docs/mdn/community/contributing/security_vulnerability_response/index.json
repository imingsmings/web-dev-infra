The next step was to post a comment on each of the open pull requests informing the user of the problem and what their next steps should be. Here is an <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/1144\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">example</a> of our answer.</p>\n<p>With this, we felt rather confident that between us reaching out, and coverage of the issue online by npm and other channels, would ensure that we ensured our users are safe.</p>\n<p>As a final step, we tweeted from our official Twitter account to raise awareness of the issue.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"in_closing","title":"In closing","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Hopefully, these types of incidents will be few and far between.
