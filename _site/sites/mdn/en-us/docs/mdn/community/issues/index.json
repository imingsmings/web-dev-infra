Fixing some of these issues can also provide the necessary practice to beginner contributors who are starting to get familiar with the contribution process.

You can time-box this task to 5-10 minutes.</p>\n<p>For example, as a triager, you can add the following information to the issue you are triaging:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><p class=\"example-header\"><span class=\"language-name\">md</span></p><pre class=\"brush: md notranslate\"><code>To whoever fixes this issue, it looks like the following is needed:\n\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Update the first paragraph below heading X to correct the problem with Y\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Add a description of X\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Update the compatibility data at Link-X\n</code></pre></div>\n<h4 id=\"set_other_labels\">Set other labels</h4>\n<p>Next, set the following labels as appropriate:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>effort: small</code>, <code>effort: medium</code>, <code>effort: large</code>: Some contributors like to search for bugs based on the time and effort that will be needed to fix the bug. So where possible, you should try to provide an estimate of the required effort.</li>\n  <li><code>good first issue</code>: Set this label on the issue if the fix for the issue is really simple and if fixing the issue would provide good practice for a newcomer who is getting used to the process.</li>\n  <li><code>help wanted</code>: Set this label if the issue requires help from someone who knows about or is familiar with the topic. This is a popular label and some contributors use it to search for issues to work on in open source projects in their areas of familiarity or expertise.</li>\n  <li><code>broken link external</code>: Set this label if the issue involves a broken link to an external page.</li>\n  <li><code>document not written</code>: Set this label if the issue involves a necessary document that has not been written yet, usually because a link points to it.</li>\n  <li><code>needs content update</code>: Set this label if the issue fix in another repository will need an equivalent fix in the <code>mdn/content</code> repository.\n    <div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect3\">\n      <p><strong>Note:</strong> After the triage process is complete, remove the <code>needs triage</code> label.</p>\n    </div>\n  </li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"General guidelines for participation","id":"general_guidelines_for_participation"},{"text":"Guidelines for reporting an issue","id":"guidelines_for_reporting_an_issue"},{"text":"Guidelines for working on an issue","id":"guidelines_for_working_on_an_issue"},{"text":"Guidelines for triaging issues","id":"guidelines_for_triaging_issues"}],"summary":"As a contributor, you can report and work on issues.","popularity":0.0026,"modified":"2023-10-11T13:06:39.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mdn/community/issues","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mdn/community/issues/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/a15be9cc426c19e3a1a510a49c4615d56ba4415d","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Guidelines to open and work on issues","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN","title":"The MDN Web Docs project"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community","title":"Community guidelines"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Issues","title":"Guidelines to open and work on issues"}],"pageTitle":"Guidelines to open and work on issues - The MDN Web Docs project | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
