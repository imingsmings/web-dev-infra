Some contributors have committed a portion of their time to assist with the daily tasks of running MDN Web Docs. Changes to the site, including maintenance tasks, are performed by employees, contractors, and a network of partners who are all dedicated to the health, growth, and maintenance of MDN Web Docs. The project relies heavily on roles and teams in the MDN organization on GitHub to manage and incorporate changes from these different groups. A list of the organization's members can be found here.","popularity":0,"modified":"2023-09-03T22:51:45.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/mdn/community/roles_teams","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/mdn/community/roles_teams/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/773780cfa3525bb4debc56514802091cfa950a32","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"MDN Web Docs roles and teams","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN","title":"The MDN Web Docs project"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community","title":"Community guidelines"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Roles_teams","title":"MDN Web Docs roles and teams"}],"pageTitle":"MDN Web Docs roles and teams - The MDN Web Docs project | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"563af23b0c7aea801fa95208cdee44b802acc7b13ad80e668ab7fe5e01ee1d60"}
