image description, think about the valuable information of the image and how you would relay that information to someone who can read the page's content but can't load images.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Make sure the alternative text for the image is based on its context.\n  If the photo of Fluffy the dog is an avatar next to a review for Yuckymeat dog food, <code>alt=\"Fluffy\"</code> is appropriate.\n  If the same photo is part of Fluffy's animal rescue adoption page, the information conveyed in the image is relevant for prospective dog parents, such as <code>alt=\"Fluffy, a tri-color terrier with very short hair, with a tennis ball in her mouth.\"</code>.\n  The surrounding text likely has Fluffy's size and breed, so including it would be redundant.\n  Refrain from describing the image in too much detail: the prospective parent does not need to know if the dog is in- or outdoors or has a red collar and a blue leash.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With screenshots, write what you learn from the image, don't detail the screenshot's contents, and omit information readers don't need or already know.\n  For example, if you're on a page about changing settings on Bing, if you have a screenshot of a Bing search result, don't include the search term or number of results, etc., as those are not the point of the image.\n  Limit the alt to the topic at hand: how to change settings in Bing.\n  The alt might be <code>alt=\"The settings icon is in the navigation bar below the search field.\"</code>.\n  Don't include \"screenshot\" or \"Bing\" as the user doesn't need to know it's a screenshot and

technical documentation, particularly for reference material and advanced level guides.

For example, choose the dark theme if the example webpage is light-themed. It is easier to see what is going on and where the DevTools start and the page ends.</li>\n  <li>For DevTools videos, zoom in the DevTools as much as you can while still showing everything you want to show and making it look OK.</li>\n  <li>Make sure the thing you are trying to demonstrate isn't covered up by the mouse cursor.</li>\n  <li>Consider whether or not it would be useful to configure the screen recording tool to add a visual indicator of mouse clicks.</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"guidelines_for_video_tools","title":"Guidelines for video tools","isH3":false,"content":"<p>\n  You'll need a tool for recording the video.\n  These range from free to expensive and simple to complex.\n  If you are already experienced in creating video content, then great.\n  If not, then we'd recommend that you start with a simple tool and then work up to something more complex if you start to enjoy creating video content and want to create more interesting productions.\n</p>\n<p>The following table provides some recommendations for good starter tools:</p>\n<figure class=\"table-container\"><table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Tool</th>\n      <th>OS</th>\n      <th>Cost</th>\n      <th>Post-production features available?</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Open Broadcaster Software</td>\n      <td>macOS, Windows, Linux</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>CamStudio</td>\n      <td>Windows</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Limited</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Camtasia</td>\n      <td>Windows, macOS</td>\n      <td>High</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>QuickTime Player</td>\n      <td>macOS</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>No, just allows simple recording</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>ScreenFlow</td>\n      <td>macOS</td>\n      <td>Medium</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Kazam</td>\n      <td>Linux</td>\n      <td>Free</td>\n      <td>Minimal</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table></figure>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"quicktime_player_tips","title":"QuickTime Player tips","isH3":true,"content":"<p>\n  If you are using macOS, you should have QuickTime Player available.\n  The recording steps using this tool are pretty simple:\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Choose <em>File</em> &gt; <em>New Screen Recording</em> from the main menu.</li>\n  <li>In the <em>Screen Recording</em> box, hit the record button (the red round button).</li>\n  <li>Drag a rectangle round the area of the screen you want to record.</li>\n  <li>Press the <em>Start Recording</em> button.</li>\n  <li>Perform whatever actions you want to record.</li>\n  <li>Press the <em>Stop</em> button.</li>\n  <li>Choose <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Export As...</em> &gt; <em>1080p</em> from the main menu to save as hi definition.</li>\n</ol>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"other_resources","title":"Other resources","isH3":true,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-add-custom-callouts-to-screencast-videos-in-screenflow--cms-27122\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">How to Add Custom Callouts to Screencast Videos in Screenflow</a></li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"workflow_for_creating_videos","title":"Workflow for creating videos","isH3":false,"content":"<p>The following subsections describe the general steps you'd want to follow to create a video and add it to an MDN Web Docs article.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"preparing","title":"Preparing","isH3":true,"content":"<p>First, plan the flow you want to capture: consider the best points to start and end.</p>\n<p>\n  Make sure the desktop background and your browser profile are clean.\n  Plan the size and positioning of browser windows, especially if you will be using multiple windows.\n</p>\n<p>Plan carefully what you are actually going to record, and practice the steps a few times before recording them:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Don't start a video in the middle of a process — consider whether the viewer will have enough context for your actions to make sense of them.\n    In a short DevTools video for example, it is a good idea to start by opening the DevTools to allow the viewer to get oriented.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Consider what your actions are, slow down, and make them obvious.\n    Whenever you have to perform an action (say, click an icon), take it slow and make it obvious.
