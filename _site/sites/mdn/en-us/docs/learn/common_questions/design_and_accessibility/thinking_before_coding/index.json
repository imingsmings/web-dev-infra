Technique comes second.</p>\n<p>Technique is obviously critical. Musicians must master their instrument. But good musicians can never produce good music without an idea. Therefore, before jumping into the technical side — for example, code and tools—you must first step back and decide in detail what you want to do.</p>\n<p>An hour's discussion with friends is a good start, but inadequate.

Are you sure?</p>\n<p>Let's look back at our example. We have five goals connected to music, one goal related to personal life (finding a new apartment), and the completely unrelated cat photos. Is it reasonable to build a single website to cover all those goals? Is it even necessary? After all, scores of existing web services might bring you to your goals without building a new website.</p>\n<p>Finding a new apartment is a prime case where it makes more sense to use existing resources rather than build a whole new site. Why? Because we'll spend more time building and maintaining the website rather than actually searching for a new apartment. Since our goal is what matters most, we should spend our energy on leveraging existing tools rather than starting from scratch. Again, there are so many web services already available for showcasing photos that it isn't worth the effort to build a new site just to spread the word about how cute our cats are.</p>\n<p>The other five goals are all connected to music. There are, of course, many web services that could handle these goals, but it makes sense in this case to build a dedicated website of our own. Such a website is the best way to <em>aggregate</em> all the stuff we want to publish in a single place (good for goals 3, 5, and 6) and promote <em>interaction</em> between us and the public (good for goals 2 and 4). In short, since these goals all revolve around the same topic, having everything in one place will help us meet our goals and help our followers connect with us.</p>\n<p>How can a website help me reach my goals? By answering that, you'll find the best way to reach your goals and save yourself from wasted effort.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"what_needs_to_be_done_and_in_what_order_to_reach_my_goals","title":"What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Now that you know what you want to accomplish, it's time to turn those goals into actionable steps. As a side note, your goals are not necessarily set in stone. They evolve over time even in the course of the project, especially if you run across unexpected obstacles or just change your mind.</p>\n<p>Rather than go through a long explanation, let's go back to our example with this table:</p>\n<figure class=\"table-container\"><table class=\"standard-table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"col\">Goals</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">Things to do</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Let people hear your music</td>\n      <td>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Record music</li>\n          <li>\n            Prepare some audio files usable online (Could you do this with\n            existing web services?)\n          </li>\n          <li>Give people access to your music on some part of your website</li>\n        </ol>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Talk about your music</td>\n      <td>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Write a few articles to start the discussion</li>\n          <li>Define how articles should look</li>\n          <li>Publish those articles on the website (How to do this?)</li>\n        </ol>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Meet other musicians</td>\n      <td>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            Provide ways for people to contact you (Email?

First, some of these items are not web-related (e.g., record music, write articles). Often those offline activities matter even more than the web side of the project. In sales, for instance, it's far more important and time-consuming to handle supply, payment, and shipment than to build a website where people can place orders.</p>\n<p>Second, setting out actionable steps leads to new questions you'll need to answer. Usually there turn out to be more questions than we originally thought.
