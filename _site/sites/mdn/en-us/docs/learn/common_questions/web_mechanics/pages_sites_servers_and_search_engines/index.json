One website may have several webpages, e.g., the Science section (the website) will have books on heat, sound, thermodynamics, statics, etc. (the webpages). Webpages can each be found at a unique location (URL).</li>\n  <li>The search index is like the search engine.

Let's make it clear: A <strong><em>browser</em></strong> is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages; a <strong><em>search engine</em></strong> is a website that helps people find web pages from other websites. The confusion arises because, the first time someone launches a browser, the browser displays a search engine's homepage. This makes sense, because, obviously, the first thing you want to do with a browser is to find a web page to display. Don't confuse the infrastructure (e.g., the browser) with the service (e.g., the search engine).
