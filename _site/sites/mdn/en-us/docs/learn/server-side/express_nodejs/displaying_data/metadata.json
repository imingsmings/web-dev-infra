Along the way, we've gained a lot of fundamental knowledge about controllers, managing flow control when using asynchronous operations, creating views using Pug, querying the site's database using models, passing information to a view, and creating and extending templates. The challenges will also have taught readers a little about date handling using Luxon.","popularity":0.017,"modified":"2023-07-03T10:12:35.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/server-side/express_nodejs/displaying_data","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/server-side/express_nodejs/displaying_data/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/bb026bcb88b7f45374d602301b7b0db5a49ff303","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Express Tutorial Part 5: Displaying library data","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side","title":"Server-side website programming"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs","title":"Express web framework (Node.js/JavaScript)"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Displaying_data","title":"Express Tutorial Part 5: Displaying library data"}],"pageTitle":"Express Tutorial Part 5: Displaying library data - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"c4568705b91b83add67a901d25047518a12258b540b4ce04da643cc58924beed"}
