It has also provided a high level overview of a few popular frameworks, and discussed criteria for choosing a web application framework. You should now have at least an idea of how to choose a web framework for your own server-side development. If not, then don't worry â€” later on in the course we'll give you detailed tutorials on Django and Express to give you some experience of actually working with a web framework.","popularity":0.0166,"modified":"2023-07-03T10:12:35.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/server-side/first_steps/web_frameworks","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/server-side/first_steps/web_frameworks/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/bb026bcb88b7f45374d602301b7b0db5a49ff303","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Server-side web frameworks","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side","title":"Server-side website programming"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps","title":"Server-side website programming first steps"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks","title":"Server-side web frameworks"}],"pageTitle":"Server-side web frameworks - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"32714db12f19d717f63e232b71d44bf4bc1cceaad8ad990467316a8f5459cd75"}
