We have seen special Unicode characters that are commonly found in math formulas and given an overview of some observable behaviors of the <mi> and <mo> elements. In the next article, we will see how to rely on token elements to build much complex expressions such as fractions and roots.","popularity":0.0013,"modified":"2023-10-13T13:06:04.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/text_containers","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/text_containers/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c75b7911b520a770c081003cf0e3baaf7034adaf","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"MathML Text Containers","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML","title":"Writing mathematics with MathML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps","title":"MathML first steps overview"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Text_containers","title":"MathML Text Containers"}],"pageTitle":"MathML Text Containers - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"5df5fafa18674d37e244827a3d664c5a202e0bd9f20e3f24c3f57f20d4062e88"}
