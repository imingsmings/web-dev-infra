We noticed some special feature of these elements, namely the fraction and radical symbol. We've seen how to use the linethickness attribute to draw fractions without bars. In the next article, we will continue with basic math notations and consider scripts.","popularity":0.0011,"modified":"2023-07-19T01:10:36.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/fractions_and_roots","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/fractions_and_roots/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/270f4aba548bddc83bb6b7f7dbb3c71c6c4e893c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"MathML fractions and roots","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML","title":"Writing mathematics with MathML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps","title":"MathML first steps overview"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Fractions_and_roots","title":"MathML fractions and roots"}],"pageTitle":"MathML fractions and roots - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8bb56292e94ef66a0ae233dc2b380e9ab5bac4b6a3647205aa35f2d33aff8fe0"}
