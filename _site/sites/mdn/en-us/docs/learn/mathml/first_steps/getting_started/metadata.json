We have learned about rendering differences between <math> elements that use display=\"block\" or not. In addition, we stumbled upon a couple of other MathML elements: <mfrac> for fractions, <mrow> for grouping and finally a few text elements. We will analyze these text containers further in the next article.","popularity":0.0032,"modified":"2023-07-07T07:19:19.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/getting_started","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/mathml/first_steps/getting_started/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/acfe8c9f1f4145f77653a2bc64a9744b001358dc","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Getting started with MathML","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML","title":"Writing mathematics with MathML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps","title":"MathML first steps overview"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Getting_started","title":"Getting started with MathML"}],"pageTitle":"Getting started with MathML - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"dc2ea1facd0684cb48f66f99635fcaff4fea369745a40108d8f58d1de8bad776"}
