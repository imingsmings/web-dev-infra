You should also appreciate that objects are very useful as structures for storing related data and functionality — if you tried to keep track of all the properties and methods in our person object as separate variables and functions, it would be inefficient and frustrating, and we'd run the risk of clashing with other variables and functions that have the same names. Objects let us keep the information safely locked away in their own package, out of harm's way.","popularity":0.0548,"modified":"2023-10-04T23:23:49.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/javascript/objects/basics","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/javascript/objects/basics/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/e3faa375b0179de77a5eff00074e3d168a0a904c","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"JavaScript object basics","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects","title":"Introducing JavaScript objects"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics","title":"JavaScript object basics"}],"pageTitle":"JavaScript object basics - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"25abc94b308507dbfdbee47827e9aafe1c2736a7eaa48cd932dbaa7e68a1872f"}
