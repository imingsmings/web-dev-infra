Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.","popularity":0.1188,"modified":"2023-06-30T06:21:35.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/html/introduction_to_html","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/html/introduction_to_html/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/751d58669499de0c6ea0d5b356e0e1448418c5d3","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Introduction to HTML","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML","title":"HTML"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML","title":"Introduction to HTML"}],"pageTitle":"Introduction to HTML - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"58c75877ade2e3ac67324ab1d2a353d00a9ab2be4df753141fa077d853db7f60"}
