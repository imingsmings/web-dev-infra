The most popular VCS (at least among web developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that provides hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about both of them.","popularity":0.01,"modified":"2023-07-03T10:12:35.000Z","source":{"folder":"en-us/learn/tools_and_testing/github","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn/tools_and_testing/github/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/bb026bcb88b7f45374d602301b7b0db5a49ff303","filename":"index.md"},"short_title":"Git and GitHub","parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn","title":"Guides"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing","title":"Tools and testing"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/GitHub","title":"Git and GitHub"}],"pageTitle":"Git and GitHub - Learn web development | MDN","noIndexing":false,"hash":"8a5be285d38a9c4b24644e4bec2a42b4d282b6cfc979b522d724b1fd62d2889e"}
